Sovereignty, though its meanings have varied across history, also has a core meaning, supreme authority within a territory. It is a modern notion of political authority. Historical variants can be understood along three dimensions — the holder of sovereignty, the absoluteness of sovereignty, and the internal and external dimensions of sovereignty. The state is the political institution in which sovereignty is embodied. An assemblage of states forms a sovereign states system.

尽管主权的含义在历史上各不相同，但它有一个核心含义，即领土内的最高权力。它是现代政治权威的概念。主权在历史上的变体可以从三个维度来理解——主权的持有者、主权的绝对性以及主权的内部和外部维度。国家是体现主权的政治体制。国家的集合构成了主权国家体系。



The history of sovereignty can be understood through two broad movements, manifested in both practical institutions and political thought. The first is the development of a system of sovereign states, culminating at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Contemporaneously, sovereignty became prominent in political thought through the writings of Machiavelli, Luther, Bodin, and Hobbes. The second movement is the circumscription of the sovereign state, which began in practice after World War II and has since continued through European integration and the growth and strengthening of laws and practices to protect human rights. The most prominent corresponding political thought occurs in the writings of critics of sovereignty like Bertrand de Jouvenel and Jacques Maritain.

主权的历史可以通过两大运动来理解，这两大运动既体现在实际制度中，也体现在政治思想中。首先是主权国家体系的发展，其高潮是1648年的《威斯特伐利亚和约》。与此同时，通过马基雅维利、路德、博丹和霍布斯的著作，主权在政治思想中变得十分突出。第二个运动是对主权国家的限定，这一运动在第二次世界大战后开始实践，并通过欧洲一体化以及保护人权的法律和实践的发展和加强而延续至今。与此相应的最突出的政治思想出现在贝特朗·德·儒弗内尔（Bertrand de Jouvenel）和雅克·马里坦（Jacques Maritain）等主权批判者的著作中。

# 主权的定义

In medievalist Ernest Kantorowicz’s classic, The King’s Two Bodies (1957), he describes a profound transformation in the concept of political authority over the course of the Middle Ages. The change began when the concept of the body of Christ evolved into a notion of two bodies — one, the corpus naturale, the consecrated host on the altar, the other, the corpus mysticum, the social body of the church with its attendant administrative structure. This latter notion — of a collective social organization having an enduring, mystical essence — would come to be transferred to political entities, the body politic. Kantorowicz then describes the emergence, in the late Middle Ages, of the concept of the king’s two bodies, vivified in Shakespeare’s Richard II and applicable to the early modern body politic. Whereas the king’s natural, mortal body would pass away with his death, he was also thought to have an enduring, supernatural one that could not be destroyed, even by assassination, for it represented the mystical dignity and justice of the body politic. The modern polity that emerged dominant in early modern Europe manifested the qualities of the collectivity that Kantorowicz described — a single, unified one, confined within territorial borders, possessing a single set of interests, ruled by an authority that was bundled into a single entity and held supremacy in advancing the interests of the polity. Though in early modern times, kings would hold this authority, later practitioners of it would include the people ruling through a constitution, nations, the Communist Party, dictators, juntas, and theocracies. The modern polity is known as the state, and the fundamental characteristic of authority within it, sovereignty.

在中世纪学者欧内斯特·康托洛维茨（Ernest Kantorowicz）的经典作品《国王的两个身体》（The King's Two Bodies，1957年）中，他描述了中世纪政治权威概念的深刻转变。这一转变始于基督身体的概念演变为两个身体的概念——一个是自然身体，即祭坛上的圣体；另一个是神秘身体，即教会的社会身体及其附带的行政结构。后一种概念——具有持久、神秘本质的集体社会组织——将被转用于政治实体，即政治体。随后，康托洛维茨描述了中世纪晚期出现的国王的两个身体的概念，这一概念在莎士比亚的《理查二世》中得到了生动的表达，并适用于现代早期的政治体。人们认为，国王的自然、凡人之躯会随着他的死亡而消逝，而他还有一个永恒的、超自然的躯体，即使被暗杀也不会被摧毁，因为它代表着政治体的神秘的尊严和正义。在近代早期欧洲占主导地位的现代政体体现了康托洛维茨所描述的集体的特质——一个单一、统一的政体，局限于领土边界之内，拥有单一的利益，由一个捆绑成单一实体的权力机构统治，在促进政体利益方面拥有至高无上的地位。虽然在近代早期，国王拥有这种权力，但后来的实践者包括通过宪法统治的人民、国家、共产党、独裁者、军政府和神权政体。现代政体被称为国家，而其中权力的基本特征则是主权。


The evolution that Kantorowicz described is formative, for sovereignty is a signature feature of modern politics. Some scholars have doubted whether a stable, essential notion of sovereignty exists. But there is in fact a definition that captures what sovereignty came to mean in early modern Europe and of which most subsequent definitions are a variant: supreme authority within a territory. This is the quality that early modern states possessed, but which popes, emperors, kings, bishops, and most nobles and vassals during the Middle Ages lacked.

康托洛维茨所描述的演变是形成性的，因为主权是现代政治的标志性特征。一些学者怀疑是否存在一个稳定、基本的主权概念。但事实上，有一个定义可以捕捉到主权在近代早期欧洲的含义，后来的大多数定义都是这个定义的变体：领土内的最高权力。这是近代早期国家所拥有的品质，但却是中世纪的教皇、皇帝、国王、主教以及大多数贵族和附庸所缺乏的。


Each component of this definition highlights an important aspect of the concept. First, a holder of sovereignty possesses authority. That is to say, the person or entity does not merely wield coercive power, defined as A’s ability to cause B to do what he would otherwise not do. Authority is rather what philosopher R.P. Wolff proposed: “the right to command and correlatively the right to be obeyed” (Wolff, 1990, 20). What is most important here is the term “right,” connoting legitimacy. A holder of sovereignty derives authority from some mutually acknowledged source of legitimacy — natural law, a divine mandate, hereditary law, a constitution, even international law. In the contemporary era, some body of law is ubiquitously the source of sovereignty.

这一定义的每个组成部分都突出了这一概念的一个重要方面。首先，主权拥有者拥有权威。这就是说，这个人或实体不仅仅拥有强制力，强制力的定义是：A有能力让B做他本来不会做的事。相反，权威是指哲学家R.P.沃尔夫提出的：“命令的权利和被服从的权利"（Wolff, 1990, 20）。这里最重要的是“权利”一词，意味着合法性。主权拥有者的权威来自于某种共同认可的合法性来源——自然法、神授、世袭法、宪法，甚至国际法。在当代，一些法律体系普遍成为主权的来源。

But if sovereignty is a matter of authority, it is not a matter of mere authority, but of supreme authority. Supremacy is what makes the constitution of the United States superior to the government of Pennsylvania, or any holder of sovereignty different from a police chief or corporate executive. The holder of sovereignty is superior to all authorities under its purview. Supremacy, too, is endemic to modernity. During the Middle Ages, manifold authorities held some sort of legal warrant for their authority, whether feudal, canonical, or otherwise, but very rarely did such warrant confer supremacy.

但是，如果主权是一个权威问题，它就不是一个单纯的权力问题，而是一个最高权力的问题。至高无上的权威使美国宪法高于宾夕法尼亚州政府，也使任何主权拥有者不同于警察局长或公司高管。主权拥有者高于其权限范围内的所有权力机构。至高无上性也是现代性的特征。在中世纪，多方面的权力机构都拥有某种法律授权，无论是封建的、教会的还是其他的，但很少有这种授权能赋予其至高无上的地位。


A final ingredient of sovereignty is territoriality, also a feature of political authority in modernity. Territoriality is a principle by which members of a community are to be defined. It specifies that their membership derives from their residence within borders. It is a powerful principle, for it defines membership in a way that may not correspond with identity. The borders of a sovereign state may not at all circumscribe a “people” or a “nation,” and may in fact encompass several of these identities, as national self-determination and irredentist movements make evident. It is rather by simple virtue of their location within geographic borders that people belong to a state and fall under the authority of its ruler. It is within a geographic territory that modern sovereigns are supremely authoritative.

主权的最后一个要素是地域性，这也是现代政治权威的一个特征。地域性是界定社区成员的一项原则。它明确规定，成员资格源于他们在边界内的居住地。这是一个强有力的原则，因为它界定成员的方式可能与身份不一致。一个主权国家的边界可能根本没有限定一个“人民”或“国家”，而且事实上可能包含其中的几种身份，民族自决和领土收复运动就是明证。人民隶属于一个国家并接受其统治者的管辖，仅仅是因为他们位于地理边界之内。正是在地理疆域内，现代君主具有至高无上的权威。


Territoriality is now deeply taken for granted. It is a feature of authority all across the globe. Even supranational and international institutions like the European Union and the United Nations are composed of states whose membership is in turn defined territorially. This universality of form is distinctive of modernity and underlines sovereignty’s connection with modernity. Though territoriality has existed in different eras and locales, other principles of membership like family kinship, religion, tribe, and feudal ties have also held great prestige. Most vividly contrasting with territoriality is a wandering tribe, whose authority structure is completely disassociated with a particular piece of land. Territoriality specifies by what quality citizens are subject to authority — their geographic location within a set of boundaries. International relations theorists have indeed pointed out the similarity between sovereignty and another institution in which lines demarcate land — private property. Indeed, the two prominently rose together in the thought of Thomas Hobbes.

现在，“地域性”已被视为理所当然。它是全球各地权威的一个特征。即使是像欧盟和联合国这样的超国家国际机构，也是由国家组成的，而这些国家的成员资格又是由领土界定的。这种形式的普遍性是现代性的独特之处，也凸显了主权与现代性的联系。尽管地域性存在于不同的时代和地方，但其他成员资格原则，如家庭亲属关系、宗教、部落和封建关系，也具有很高的威望。与地域性形成鲜明对比的是流浪部落，其权力结构完全与某块土地无关。地域性规定了公民通过什么而受制于权威——他们在一组边界内的地理位置。国际关系理论家确实指出了主权与另一种以界线划分土地的制度——私有财产——之间的相似性。事实上，在托马斯·霍布斯的思想中，这两者是并驾齐驱的。

Supreme authority within a territory — this is the general definition of sovereignty. Historical manifestations of sovereignty are almost always specific instances of this general definition. It is in fact the instances of which philosophers and the politically motivated have spoken most often, making their claim for the sovereignty of this person or that body of law. Understanding sovereignty, then, involves understanding claims to it, or at least some of the most important of these claims.

领土内的最高权力——这是主权的一般定义。主权的历史表现几乎总是这一一般定义的具体实例。事实上，哲学家和有政治动机的人最常谈论的就是这种情况，他们声称这个人或那个法律体系拥有主权。因此，要理解主权，就必须理解对主权的主张，或者至少是其中一些最重要的主张。

Over the past half millennium, these claims have taken extraordinarily diverse forms — nations asserting independence from mother states, communists seeking freedom from colonialists, the vox populi contending with ancien regimes, theocracies who reject the authority of secular states, and sundry others. It is indeed a mark of the resilience and flexibility of the sovereign state that it has accommodated such diverse sorts of authority. Though a catalog of these authorities is not possible here, three dimensions along which they may be understood will help to categorize them: the holders of sovereignty, the absolute or non-absolute nature of sovereignty, and the relationship between the internal and external dimensions of sovereignty.

在过去的半个多世纪里，这些诉求的形式异常多样——主张从母国独立的国家、寻求从殖民主义者手中获得自由的共产主义者、与旧制度抗争的民意代表、拒绝世俗国家权威的神权政体，以及其他各种诉求。主权国家能够容纳如此多种多样的权力机构，确实是其弹性和灵活性的标志。虽然在此不可能对这些权力进行分类，但可以从三个维度对其进行理解，这三个维度将有助于对其进行分类：主权的拥有者、主权的绝对性或非绝对性以及主权的内部维度和外部维度之间的关系。

As suggested, diverse authorities have held sovereignty — kings, dictators, peoples ruling through constitutions, and the like. The character of the holder of supreme authority within a territory is probably the most important dimension of sovereignty. In early modern times, French theorist Jean Bodin thought that sovereignty must reside in a single individual. Both he and English philosopher Thomas Hobbes conceived the sovereign as being above the law. Later thinkers differed, coming to envision new loci for sovereignty, but remaining committed to the principle.

如上所述，拥有主权的实体多种多样——国王、独裁者、通过宪法统治的人民等等。领土内最高权力拥有者的特征可能是主权最重要的方面。近代早期，法国理论家让·博丹认为主权必须属于一个人。他和英国哲学家托马斯·霍布斯都认为主权高于法律。后来的思想家们则有不同看法，他们为主权提出了新的定位，但仍坚持这一原则。

Sovereignty can also be absolute or non-absolute. How is it possible that sovereignty might be non-absolute if it is also supreme? After all, scholars like Alan James argue that sovereignty can only be either present or absent, and cannot exist partially (James 1999, 462–4). But here, absoluteness refers not to the extent or character of sovereignty, which must always be supreme, but rather to the scope of matters over which a holder of authority is sovereign. Bodin and Hobbes envisioned sovereignty as absolute, extending to all matters within the territory, unconditionally. It is possible for an authority to be sovereign over some matters within a territory, but not all. Today, many European Union (EU) member states exhibit non-absoluteness. They are sovereign in governing defense, but not in governing their currencies, trade policies, and many social welfare policies, which they administer in cooperation with EU authorities as set forth in EU law. Absolute sovereignty is quintessential modern sovereignty. But in recent decades, it has begun to be circumscribed by institutions like the EU, the UN’s practices of sanctioning intervention, and the international criminal court.

主权也可以是绝对的或非绝对的。如果主权是至高无上的，又怎么可能是非绝对的呢？毕竟，艾伦·詹姆斯（Alan James）等学者认为，主权只能存在或不存在，不可能部分存在（詹姆斯，1999年，462-4）。但在这里，绝对性并不是指主权的程度或特征（主权必须始终是至高无上的），而是指权力拥有者拥有主权的事项范围。博丹和霍布斯认为主权是绝对的，无条件地扩展到领土内的所有事务。一个权力机构有可能对领土内的某些事务拥有主权，但并非对所有事务拥有主权。如今，许多欧洲联盟（欧盟）成员国表现出非绝对性。它们在管理国防方面拥有主权，但在管理本国货币、贸易政策和许多社会福利政策方面却没有主权。绝对主权是现代主权的精髓。但近几十年来，欧盟、联合国制裁干预的做法以及国际刑事法院等机构开始对其进行限制。

A final pair of adjectives that define sovereignty is “internal” and “external.” In this case, the words do not describe exclusive sorts of sovereignty, but different aspects of sovereignty that are coexistent and omnipresent. Sovereign authority is exercised within borders, but also, by definition, with respect to outsiders, who may not interfere with the sovereign’s governance. The state has been the chief holder of external sovereignty since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, after which interference in other states’ governing prerogatives became illegitimate. The concept of sovereignty in international law most often connotes external sovereignty. Alan James similarly conceives of external sovereignty as constitutional independence — a state’s freedom from outside influence upon its basic prerogatives (James 1999, 460–462). Significantly, external sovereignty depends on recognition by outsiders. To states, this recognition is what a no-trespassing law is to private property — a set of mutual understandings that give property, or the state, immunity from outside interference. It is also external sovereignty that establishes the basic condition of international relations — anarchy, meaning the lack of a higher authority that makes claims on lower authorities. An assemblage of states, both internally and externally sovereign, makes up an international system, where sovereign entities ally, trade, make war, and make peace.

定义主权的最后一对形容词是“内部”和“外部”。在这种情况下，这两个词描述的并不是排他性的主权，而是共存且无所不在的主权的不同方面。主权权力在边界内行使，但顾名思义，也针对外人行使，外人不得干涉主权者的治理。自1648 年《威斯特伐利亚和约》签订以来，国家一直是外部主权的主要持有者，此后，干涉其他国家的治理特权就变得不合法了。国际法中的主权概念通常是指外部主权。Alan James同样将外部主权视为宪法独立——一个国家的基本特权不受外界影响（James 1999, 460-462）。重要的是，外部主权取决于外部的承认。对国家而言，这种承认就像禁止非法入侵法对私有财产一样——一套相互理解，使财产或国家免受外来干涉。也正是外部主权确立了国际关系的基本条件--无政府状态，即缺乏向下级权力机构提出要求的上级权力机构。内部和外部主权国家的集合构成了一个国际体系，主权实体在这个体系中结盟、贸易、战争与媾和。
