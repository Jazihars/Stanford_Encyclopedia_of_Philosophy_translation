Sovereignty, though its meanings have varied across history, also has a core meaning, supreme authority within a territory. It is a modern notion of political authority. Historical variants can be understood along three dimensions — the holder of sovereignty, the absoluteness of sovereignty, and the internal and external dimensions of sovereignty. The state is the political institution in which sovereignty is embodied. An assemblage of states forms a sovereign states system.

主权——尽管它的含义在历史上不断变化，但它有一个核心含义，即一块领土内的最高权力。它是政治权威的现代概念。主权在历史上的变种可以从三个维度来理解——主权的拥有者、主权的绝对性以及主权的内部和外部维度。国家是体现主权的政治体制。国家的集合构成了主权国家体系。



The history of sovereignty can be understood through two broad movements, manifested in both practical institutions and political thought. The first is the development of a system of sovereign states, culminating at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Contemporaneously, sovereignty became prominent in political thought through the writings of Machiavelli, Luther, Bodin, and Hobbes. The second movement is the circumscription of the sovereign state, which began in practice after World War II and has since continued through European integration and the growth and strengthening of laws and practices to protect human rights. The most prominent corresponding political thought occurs in the writings of critics of sovereignty like Bertrand de Jouvenel and Jacques Maritain.

主权的历史可以通过两大运动来理解，这两大运动既体现在实际制度中，也体现在政治思想中。首先是主权国家体系的发展，其高潮是1648年的《威斯特伐利亚和约》。与此同时，经由马基雅维利、路德、博丹和霍布斯的著作，主权在政治思想中变得十分突出。第二个运动是对主权国家的限制，这一运动在第二次世界大战后开始实践，并通过欧洲一体化以及保护人权的法律和实践的发展和加强而延续至今。与此相应的最突出的政治思想出现在贝特朗·德·儒弗内尔（Bertrand de Jouvenel）和雅克·马里坦（Jacques Maritain）等主权批判者的著作中。

## 主权的定义

In medievalist Ernest Kantorowicz’s classic, The King’s Two Bodies (1957), he describes a profound transformation in the concept of political authority over the course of the Middle Ages. The change began when the concept of the body of Christ evolved into a notion of two bodies — one, the corpus naturale, the consecrated host on the altar, the other, the corpus mysticum, the social body of the church with its attendant administrative structure. This latter notion — of a collective social organization having an enduring, mystical essence — would come to be transferred to political entities, the body politic. Kantorowicz then describes the emergence, in the late Middle Ages, of the concept of the king’s two bodies, vivified in Shakespeare’s Richard II and applicable to the early modern body politic. Whereas the king’s natural, mortal body would pass away with his death, he was also thought to have an enduring, supernatural one that could not be destroyed, even by assassination, for it represented the mystical dignity and justice of the body politic. The modern polity that emerged dominant in early modern Europe manifested the qualities of the collectivity that Kantorowicz described — a single, unified one, confined within territorial borders, possessing a single set of interests, ruled by an authority that was bundled into a single entity and held supremacy in advancing the interests of the polity. Though in early modern times, kings would hold this authority, later practitioners of it would include the people ruling through a constitution, nations, the Communist Party, dictators, juntas, and theocracies. The modern polity is known as the state, and the fundamental characteristic of authority within it, sovereignty.

在中世纪学者欧内斯特·康托洛维茨（Ernest Kantorowicz）的经典作品《国王的两个身体》（The King's Two Bodies，1957年）中，他描述了中世纪政治权威概念的深刻转变。这一转变始于基督身体的概念演变为两个身体的概念——一个是自然身体，即祭坛上的圣体；另一个是神秘身体，即教会的社会实体及其附带的行政结构。后一种概念——具有持久、神秘本质的集体社会组织——将会转换为用于政治实体，即政治体。随后，康托洛维茨描述了中世纪晚期出现的国王的两个身体的概念，这一概念在莎士比亚的《理查二世》中得到了生动表达，并适用于现代早期的政治体。尽管国王的自然、凡人之躯会随着他的死亡而消逝，而他还有一个永恒的、超自然的躯体，即使被暗杀也不会被摧毁，因为它代表着政治体的神秘的尊严和正义。近代早期欧洲占主导地位的现代政体体现了康托洛维茨所描述的集体的特质——一个单一、统一的政体，局限于领土边界之内，拥有单一的利益，由一个捆绑成单一实体的权力机构统治，在促进政体利益方面拥有至高无上的地位。虽然在近代早期，国王拥有这种权力，但后来的实践者包括通过宪法统治的人民、国家、共产党、独裁者、军政府和神权政体。现代政体被称为国家，而其中权力的基本特征则是主权。


The evolution that Kantorowicz described is formative, for sovereignty is a signature feature of modern politics. Some scholars have doubted whether a stable, essential notion of sovereignty exists. But there is in fact a definition that captures what sovereignty came to mean in early modern Europe and of which most subsequent definitions are a variant: supreme authority within a territory. This is the quality that early modern states possessed, but which popes, emperors, kings, bishops, and most nobles and vassals during the Middle Ages lacked.

康托洛维茨所描述的演变是形成性的，因为主权是现代政治的标志性特征。一些学者怀疑是否存在一个稳定、基本的主权概念。但事实上，有一个定义可以捕捉到主权在现代早期欧洲的含义，后来的大多数定义都是这个定义的变体：领土内的最高权力。这是早期现代国家所拥有的品质，但却是中世纪的教皇、皇帝、国王、主教以及大多数贵族和附庸所缺乏的。


Each component of this definition highlights an important aspect of the concept. First, a holder of sovereignty possesses authority. That is to say, the person or entity does not merely wield coercive power, defined as A’s ability to cause B to do what he would otherwise not do. Authority is rather what philosopher R.P. Wolff proposed: “the right to command and correlatively the right to be obeyed” (Wolff, 1990, 20). What is most important here is the term “right,” connoting legitimacy. A holder of sovereignty derives authority from some mutually acknowledged source of legitimacy — natural law, a divine mandate, hereditary law, a constitution, even international law. In the contemporary era, some body of law is ubiquitously the source of sovereignty.

这一定义的每个组成部分都突出了这一概念的一个重要方面。首先，主权拥有者拥有权威。这就是说，这个人或实体不仅仅拥有强制力，强制力的定义是：A有能力让B做他本来不会做的事。相反，权威是指哲学家R.P.沃尔夫提出的：“命令的权利和被服从的权利"（Wolff, 1990, 20）。这里最重要的是“权利”一词，意味着合法性。主权拥有者的权威来自于某种共同认可的合法性来源——自然法、神授、世袭法、宪法，甚至国际法。在当代，一些法律体系普遍成为主权的来源。

But if sovereignty is a matter of authority, it is not a matter of mere authority, but of supreme authority. Supremacy is what makes the constitution of the United States superior to the government of Pennsylvania, or any holder of sovereignty different from a police chief or corporate executive. The holder of sovereignty is superior to all authorities under its purview. Supremacy, too, is endemic to modernity. During the Middle Ages, manifold authorities held some sort of legal warrant for their authority, whether feudal, canonical, or otherwise, but very rarely did such warrant confer supremacy.

但是，如果主权是一个权威问题，它就不仅仅是权威问题，而是一个最高权威的问题。至高无上性使美国宪法高于宾夕法尼亚州政府，也使任何主权拥有者不同于警察局长或公司高管。主权拥有者高于其权限范围内的所有权力机构。至高无上性也是现代性的特征。在中世纪，许多权力机构都拥有某种法律授权，无论是封建的、教会的还是其他的，但很少有这种授权能赋予其至高无上的地位。


A final ingredient of sovereignty is territoriality, also a feature of political authority in modernity. Territoriality is a principle by which members of a community are to be defined. It specifies that their membership derives from their residence within borders. It is a powerful principle, for it defines membership in a way that may not correspond with identity. The borders of a sovereign state may not at all circumscribe a “people” or a “nation,” and may in fact encompass several of these identities, as national self-determination and irredentist movements make evident. It is rather by simple virtue of their location within geographic borders that people belong to a state and fall under the authority of its ruler. It is within a geographic territory that modern sovereigns are supremely authoritative.

主权的最后一个要素是地域性，这也是现代政治权威的一个特征。地域性是界定社区成员的一项原则。它明确规定，成员资格源于他们在领土边界内的居所。这是一个强有力的原则，因为它界定成员的方式可能与身份不一致。一个主权国家的边界可能根本没有限定一个“人民”或“国家”，而且事实上可能包含其中的几种身份，民族自决和领土收复运动就是明证。人民隶属于一个国家并接受其统治者的管辖，仅仅是因为他们位于地理边界之内。正是在地理疆域内，现代主权者具有至高无上的权威。


Territoriality is now deeply taken for granted. It is a feature of authority all across the globe. Even supranational and international institutions like the European Union and the United Nations are composed of states whose membership is in turn defined territorially. This universality of form is distinctive of modernity and underlines sovereignty’s connection with modernity. Though territoriality has existed in different eras and locales, other principles of membership like family kinship, religion, tribe, and feudal ties have also held great prestige. Most vividly contrasting with territoriality is a wandering tribe, whose authority structure is completely disassociated with a particular piece of land. Territoriality specifies by what quality citizens are subject to authority — their geographic location within a set of boundaries. International relations theorists have indeed pointed out the similarity between sovereignty and another institution in which lines demarcate land — private property. Indeed, the two prominently rose together in the thought of Thomas Hobbes.

现在，“地域性”已被视为理所当然。它是全球各地权威的一个特征。即使是像欧盟和联合国这样的超国家国际机构，也是由国家组成的，而这些国家的成员资格又是由领土界定的。这种形式的普遍性是现代性的独特之处，也凸显了主权与现代性的联系。尽管地域性存在于不同的时代和地区，但其他界定成员资格的原则，如家庭亲属关系、宗教、部落和封建关系，也具有很高的威望。与地域性形成鲜明对比的是流浪部落，其权力结构完全与某块特定的土地无关。地域性规定了公民通过什么而受制于权威——他们在一组边界内的地理位置。国际关系理论家确实指出了主权与另一种以界线划分土地的制度——私有财产——之间的相似性。事实上，在托马斯·霍布斯的思想中，这两者是并驾齐驱的。

Supreme authority within a territory — this is the general definition of sovereignty. Historical manifestations of sovereignty are almost always specific instances of this general definition. It is in fact the instances of which philosophers and the politically motivated have spoken most often, making their claim for the sovereignty of this person or that body of law. Understanding sovereignty, then, involves understanding claims to it, or at least some of the most important of these claims.

领土内的最高权力——这是主权的一般定义。历史上主权的体现几乎总是这一一般定义的具体实例。事实上，哲学家和有政治动机的人最常谈论的就是这种情况，他们声称这个人或那个法律体系拥有主权。因此，要理解主权，就必须理解对主权的主张，或者至少是其中一些最重要的主张。

Over the past half millennium, these claims have taken extraordinarily diverse forms — nations asserting independence from mother states, communists seeking freedom from colonialists, the vox populi contending with ancien regimes, theocracies who reject the authority of secular states, and sundry others. It is indeed a mark of the resilience and flexibility of the sovereign state that it has accommodated such diverse sorts of authority. Though a catalog of these authorities is not possible here, three dimensions along which they may be understood will help to categorize them: the holders of sovereignty, the absolute or non-absolute nature of sovereignty, and the relationship between the internal and external dimensions of sovereignty.

在过去的半个多世纪里，这些主张的形式异常多样——主张从母国独立的国家、寻求从殖民主义者手中获得自由的共产主义者、与旧制度抗争的民意代表、拒绝世俗国家权威的神权政体，以及其他各种诉求。主权国家能够容纳如此多种多样的权威，确实是其弹性和灵活性的标志。虽然在此不可能对这些权威进行分类，但可以从三个维度对其进行理解，这三个维度将有助于对其进行分类：主权的拥有者、主权的绝对性或非绝对性以及主权的内部维度和外部维度之间的关系。

As suggested, diverse authorities have held sovereignty — kings, dictators, peoples ruling through constitutions, and the like. The character of the holder of supreme authority within a territory is probably the most important dimension of sovereignty. In early modern times, French theorist Jean Bodin thought that sovereignty must reside in a single individual. Both he and English philosopher Thomas Hobbes conceived the sovereign as being above the law. Later thinkers differed, coming to envision new loci for sovereignty, but remaining committed to the principle.

如上所述，拥有主权的权威多种多样——国王、独裁者、通过宪法统治的人民等等。领土内最高权力拥有者这一特征可能是主权最重要的方面。现代早期，法国理论家让·博丹认为主权必须属于一个人。他和英国哲学家托马斯·霍布斯都认为主权高于法律。后来的思想家们则有不同看法，他们为主权提出了新的定位，但仍坚持这一原则。

Sovereignty can also be absolute or non-absolute. How is it possible that sovereignty might be non-absolute if it is also supreme? After all, scholars like Alan James argue that sovereignty can only be either present or absent, and cannot exist partially (James 1999, 462–4). But here, absoluteness refers not to the extent or character of sovereignty, which must always be supreme, but rather to the scope of matters over which a holder of authority is sovereign. Bodin and Hobbes envisioned sovereignty as absolute, extending to all matters within the territory, unconditionally. It is possible for an authority to be sovereign over some matters within a territory, but not all. Today, many European Union (EU) member states exhibit non-absoluteness. They are sovereign in governing defense, but not in governing their currencies, trade policies, and many social welfare policies, which they administer in cooperation with EU authorities as set forth in EU law. Absolute sovereignty is quintessential modern sovereignty. But in recent decades, it has begun to be circumscribed by institutions like the EU, the UN’s practices of sanctioning intervention, and the international criminal court.

主权也可以是绝对的或非绝对的。如果主权是至高无上的，又何以可能是非绝对的呢？毕竟，艾伦·詹姆斯（Alan James）等学者认为，主权只能存在或不存在，不可能部分存在（詹姆斯，1999年，462-4）。但在这里，绝对性并不是指主权的程度或特征（主权必须始终是至高无上的），而是指权威拥有者拥有主权的事项范围。博丹和霍布斯认为主权是绝对的，无条件地扩展到领土内的所有事务。一个权力机构有可能对领土内的某些事务拥有主权，但并非对所有事务拥有主权。如今，许多欧洲联盟（欧盟）成员国表现出主权的非绝对性。它们在管理国防方面拥有主权，但在管理本国货币、贸易政策和许多社会福利政策方面却没有主权。绝对主权是现代主权的精髓。但近几十年来，欧盟、联合国制裁干预的做法以及国际刑事法院等机构开始对其进行限制。

A final pair of adjectives that define sovereignty is “internal” and “external.” In this case, the words do not describe exclusive sorts of sovereignty, but different aspects of sovereignty that are coexistent and omnipresent. Sovereign authority is exercised within borders, but also, by definition, with respect to outsiders, who may not interfere with the sovereign’s governance. The state has been the chief holder of external sovereignty since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, after which interference in other states’ governing prerogatives became illegitimate. The concept of sovereignty in international law most often connotes external sovereignty. Alan James similarly conceives of external sovereignty as constitutional independence — a state’s freedom from outside influence upon its basic prerogatives (James 1999, 460–462). Significantly, external sovereignty depends on recognition by outsiders. To states, this recognition is what a no-trespassing law is to private property — a set of mutual understandings that give property, or the state, immunity from outside interference. It is also external sovereignty that establishes the basic condition of international relations — anarchy, meaning the lack of a higher authority that makes claims on lower authorities. An assemblage of states, both internally and externally sovereign, makes up an international system, where sovereign entities ally, trade, make war, and make peace.

定义主权的最后一对形容词是“内部”和“外部”。在这种情况下，这两个词描述的并不是排他性的主权，而是共存且无所不在的主权的不同方面。主权者在边界内行使主权，但顾名思义，也针对边界外的人行使，边界外的人不得干涉主权者的治理。自1648年《威斯特伐利亚和约》签订以来，国家一直是外部主权的主要持有者，此后，干涉其他国家的统治特权就变得不合法了。国际法中的主权概念通常是指外部主权。艾伦·詹姆斯（Alan James）同样将外部主权视为宪法独立——一个国家的基本特权不受外部影响（James 1999, 460-462）。重要的是，外部主权取决于外部的承认。对国家而言，这种承认就像禁止入内法对私有财产一样——一套使财产或国家免受外来干涉的相互理解。也正是外部主权确立了国际关系的基本条件——无政府状态，即缺乏向下级权力机构提出要求的上级权力机构。拥有内部和外部主权的国家集合构成了一个国际体系，主权实体在这个体系中结盟、贸易、战争与媾和。

## 主权国家的崛起：理论与实践

Supreme authority with a territory — within this definition, sovereignty can then be understood more precisely only through its history. This history can be told as one of two broad movements — the first, a centuries long evolution towards a European continent, then a globe, of sovereign states, the second, a circumscription of absolute sovereign prerogatives in the second half of the twentieth century.

领土内的最高权力——根据这一定义，只有通过主权的历史才能更准确地理解主权。这段历史可以分为两个大的部分——第一个是长达几个世纪的演变，逐渐形成了一个由主权国家组成的欧洲大陆，进而形成了一个由主权国家组成的地球；第二个是二十世纪下半叶对绝对主权特权的限制。

It was at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 that Europe consolidated its long transition from the Middle Ages to a world of sovereign states. According to historian J.R. Strayer, Britain and France looked a lot like sovereign states by around 1300, their kings possessing supremacy within bounded territories. But as late as the beginning of the Reformation in 1517, Europe remained distant from Westphalia. It was just around then that a great reversal in historical momentum occurred when Charles V of Spain ascended to the throne, uniting Castile, Aragon and the Netherlands, at the same time becoming Holy Roman Emperor, gaining prerogatives over lands in Central Europe, while taking on the role of enforcer of the Catholic Church’s still significant temporal prerogatives inside the Empire, especially its enforcement of ecclesiastical orthodoxy. But within the Empire, Charles V was not sovereign, either, for princes and nobles there retained prerogatives over which he exercised no control. In 1555, a system of sovereign states gained important ground in the Peace of Augsburg, whose formula cuius regio, eius religio, allowed German princes to enforce their own faith within their territory. But Augsburg was unstable. Manifold contests over the settlement’s provisions resulted in constant wars, culminating finally in the Thirty Years War, which did not end until 1648, at the Peace of Westphalia.

1648年的《威斯特伐利亚和约》巩固了欧洲从中世纪向主权国家的长期过渡。根据历史学家J.R.Strayer的说法，到1300年左右，英国和法国看起来很像主权国家，它们的国王在领土边界内拥有至高无上的权力。但直到1517年宗教改革开始时，欧洲仍然与威斯特伐利亚体系有很大的差别。就在那时，历史大势发生了逆转，西班牙的查理五世登基，统一了卡斯提尔、阿拉贡和尼德兰，同时成为神圣罗马帝国皇帝，获得了对中欧土地的特权，并在帝国内部承担起天主教会的重要世俗特权的执行人角色，尤其是对教会正统性的执行。但在帝国内部，查理五世仍然不是主权者，因为那里的王公贵族保留着他无法控制的特权。1555年，主权国家体系在《奥格斯堡和约》中获得了重要地位，该和约的口号 “cuius regio, eius religio”（谁的领土，信谁的宗教）允许德国王公在其领土内推行自己的信仰。但奥格斯堡和约并不稳定。对协议条款的各种争论导致了连绵不断的战争，最终导致了三十年战争，直到1648年《威斯特伐利亚和约》签署，战争才结束。

What features of Westphalia make it the origin of the sovereign states system? In fact, not all scholars agree that it deserves this status (see Krasner 1999). Nowhere in the settlement’s treaties is a sovereign states system or even the state as the reigning legitimate unit, prescribed. Certainly, Westphalia did not create a sovereign states system ex nihilo, for components of the system had been accumulating for centuries up to the settlement; afterwards, some medieval anomalies persisted. In two broad respects, though, in both legal prerogatives and practical powers, the system of sovereign states triumphed. First, states emerged as virtually the sole form of substantive constitutional authority in Europe, their authority no longer seriously challenged by the Holy Roman Empire. The Netherlands and Switzerland gained uncontested sovereignty, the German states of the Holy Roman Empire accrued the right to ally outside the empire, while both the diplomatic communications and foreign policy designs of contemporary great powers revealed a common understanding of a system of sovereign states. The temporal powers of the Church were also curtailed to the point that they no longer challenged any state’s sovereignty. In reaction, Pope Innocent X condemned the treaties of the peace as “null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all time” (quoted in Maland 1966, 16).

威斯特伐利亚和约的哪些特征使其成为主权国家体系的起源？事实上，并非所有学者都认为威斯特伐利亚和约应享有这一地位（见 Krasner 1999）。在威斯特伐利亚和约中，没有任何地方规定了主权国家制度，甚至没有规定国家是合法的统治单位。当然，威斯特伐利亚和约并没有凭空创造出一个主权国家体系，因为该体系的组成部分在和约签署之前已经积累了几个世纪；和约签署之后，一些中世纪的异常现象依然存在。不过，在法律特权和实际权力这两个大的方面，主权国家体系都取得了胜利。首先，国家几乎成为欧洲唯一的实质性的宪法权力形式，其权威不再受到神圣罗马帝国的严重挑战。荷兰和瑞士获得了无可争议的主权，神圣罗马帝国的德意志邦国获得了在帝国之外结盟的权利，同时，当代大国的外交沟通和外交政策设计都显示出对主权国家体系的共同理解。教会的世俗权力也被削减到不再挑战任何国家主权的程度。作为回应，教皇英诺森十世谴责威斯特伐利亚和约“空洞、无效、不合法、不公正、不正义、当诅咒、当谴责、毫无意义、永无效力”（引自Maland 1966年，16）。

Second, Westphalia brought an end to a long era of intervention in matters of religion, up to then the most commonly practiced abridgment of sovereign prerogatives. After decades of armed contestation, the design of the Peace of Augsburg was finally consolidated, not in the exact form of 1555, but effectively establishing the authority of princes and kings over religion. Although intervention in matters of religion did not come to an absolute end, it became exceedingly rare, this in stark contrast to the previous 130 years, when wars of religion sundered Europe. As the sovereign states system became more generalized in ensuing decades, this proscription of intervention would become more generalized, too, evolving into a foundational norm of the international system.

其次，威斯特伐利亚和约结束了漫长的干预宗教事务的时代。在此之前，宗教是最常被剥夺的主权特权。经过数十年的武装争斗，《奥格斯堡和约》的设计最终得到了巩固，虽然不是以与1555年完全一样的形式，但有效地确立了王公和国王对宗教的权威。虽然对宗教事务的干预并没有绝对停止，但却变得极为罕见，这与之前130年宗教战争横扫欧洲的情形形成了鲜明对比。在随后的几十年里，随着主权国家体系的日益普遍化，这种禁止干预的规定也变得更加普遍，逐渐成为国际体系的基本准则。

Again, not all scholars agree that Westphalia deserves its ‘founding moment’ status. Daniel Philpott has argued for the orthodoxy in (Philpott, 2001). In recent years, however, a number of scholars have come to argue that the Westphalia myth ought to be deconstructed and discarded (Krasner, 1999; Carvalho, Leira, and Hobson, 2011; Nexon, 2009; Osiander, 1994; Osiander, 2001; Teschke, 2009). Generally, these scholars stress that important elements of statehood were around long before Westphalia and that important elements of ‘hierarchy’, or circumscription of sovereignty from above, perdured long after Westphalia. Only the long-term consensus of scholars can determine how Westphalia will continue to be regarded.

同样，并非所有学者都认为威斯特伐利亚和约拥有“奠基时刻”的地位。丹尼尔·菲尔波特（Daniel Philpott）在（Philpott, 2001）一书中提出了正统观点。但近年来，一些学者认为威斯特伐利亚神话应该被解构和抛弃（Krasner, 1999; Carvalho, Leira, and Hobson, 2011; Nexon, 2009; Osiander, 1994; Osiander, 2001; Teschke, 2009）。一般来说，这些学者都强调，国家地位的重要要素早在威斯特伐利亚之前就已存在，而“等级制度”或自上而下的对主权的限制的重要要素则在威斯特伐利亚之后长期存在。只有学者们的长期共识才能决定人们将如何继续看待威斯特伐利亚。

Whether the sovereign states system was consolidated at Westphalia, took full shape at a later time, or always remained heterodox, its basic form nevertheless spread worldwide over the next three centuries, culminating in the decline of the European colonial empires in the mid-20th century, when the state became the only form of polity ever to cover the entire land surface of the globe. Today, norms of sovereignty are enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, whose article 2(4) prohibits attacks on “political independence and territorial integrity,” and whose Article 2(7) sharply restricts intervention.

无论主权国家体系是在威斯特伐利亚得到巩固，还是在后来完全形成，抑或始终保持非主流地位，其基本形式都在接下来的三个世纪传播到世界各地，并在20世纪中叶欧洲殖民帝国衰落时达到顶峰，那时国家成为覆盖全球所有陆地表面的唯一政体形式。今天，主权原则已写入《联合国宪章》，其第二条第四款禁止攻击“政治独立和领土完整”，其第二条第七款严格限制对主权的干涉。

While the section that follows this one will detail the circumscription of sovereignty following World War II, this broad historical trend should not obscure respects in which sovereignty has persisted and even resurged in recent years. In an important article, international relations scholar Roland Paris (2020) makes the case that global politics is seeing the reemergence of pre-Westphalian notions of sovereignty, including “extralegal” and “organic” versions, which contrast with Westphalian sovereignty and its norms of the legal equality of state and non-interference in domestic affairs. Paris documents this reemergence in Russia under President Vladimir Putin, China under President Xi Jinping, and the United States under President Donald Trump.

本文的下一节将详细介绍第二次世界大战后对主权的限制，但这一广泛的历史趋势不应掩盖近年来主权持续存在甚至更加扩张的状况。国际关系学者罗兰·帕里斯（Roland Paris，2020年）在一篇重要文章中指出，全球政治中重新出现了威斯特伐利亚以前的主权概念，包括“法外”和“有机”的版本，这与威斯特伐利亚主权及其国家在法律上一律平等和不干涉内政的原则形成鲜明对比。帕里斯记录了普京总统领导下的俄罗斯、习近平主席领导下的中国和唐纳德·特朗普总统领导下的美国重新出现的前威斯特伐利亚主权概念。

As the sovereign state was occupying the European continent, piece by piece, in early modern times, eventually forming the system that came to occupy the globe, contemporary political philosophers embraced this form of polity and described what made it legitimate. They were not originators of the concept, for even during medieval times, philosophers like Dante and Marsilius of Padua advocated a separation of temporal and religious powers that would be achieved through a transfer of prerogatives into temporal ruler’s hands. Then, in early modern times, there were two roughly contemporary philosophers who did not write explicitly or consciously of sovereignty, yet whose ideas amounted in substance to important developments of the concept. Machiavelli observed the politics of city states in his Renaissance Italy and described what a prince had to do to promote a flourishing republic in terms that conferred on him supreme authority within his territory. Manifestly, he was not to be bound by natural law, canon law, Gospel precepts, or any of the norms or authorities that obligated members of Christendom. Rather, he would have to be prepared “not to be good,” and to be ready to perform evil, not because evil was no longer evil, but because it was sometimes necessary to further an end that was central for Machiavelli, an end that amounts to the unifying idea of his thought: the strength and well-ordering of the state. The obligation of the prince was raison d’état. He was supreme within the state’s territory and responsible for the well being of this singular, unitary body.

随着现代早期主权国家一片片地占据欧洲大陆，最终形成了占据全球的体系，当代政治哲学家们接受了这种政体形式，并描述了使其合法化的原因。他们并非这一概念的始作俑者，因为即使在中世纪，但丁和帕多瓦的马西利乌斯等哲学家也主张通过将特权转移到世俗统治者手中来实现世俗权力与宗教权力的分离。在现代早期，有两位大致同时代的哲学家没有明确或有意识地论述主权问题，但他们的思想实质上是对主权概念的重要发展。马基雅维利观察了文艺复兴时期意大利城邦国家的政治，用赋予君主在其领土上至高无上权力的术语描述了君主为促进一个繁荣的共和国而必须做的事情。显然，他不会受到自然法、教会法、福音戒律或任何基督教王国的成员必须遵守的规范或权威的约束。相反，他必须做好 “不为善”的准备，做好作恶的准备，这并不是因为恶不再是恶，而是因为有时必须作恶才能实现马基雅维利的核心目标，这一目标相当于他思想中的一贯追求：国家的强大和秩序井然。君主的义务是“国家的理由”（raison d'état）。他是国家领土内的至高无上者，对这一独特的统一体的福祉负责。

Purveying sovereignty from quite a different perspective was Martin Luther. His theology of the Reformation advocated stripping the Catholic Church of its many powers, not only its ecclesiastical powers, but powers that are, by any modern definition, temporal. Luther held that the Church should no longer be thought of as a visible, hierarchical institution, but was rather the invisibly united aggregate of local churches that adhered to right doctrine. Thus, the Catholic Church no longer legitimately held vast tracts of land that it taxed and defended, and whose justice it administered; it was no longer legitimate for its bishops to hold temporal offices under princes and kings; nor would the Pope be able to depose secular rulers through his power of excommunication; most importantly, the Holy Roman Emperor would no longer legitimately enforce Catholic uniformity. No longer would the Church and those who acted in its name exercise political or economic authority. Who, then, would take up such relinquished powers? Territorial princes. “By the destruction of the independence of the Church and its hold on an extra-territorial public opinion, the last obstacle to unity within the State was removed,” writes political philosopher J.N. Figgis (72). It was this vision that triumphed at Westphalia.

马丁·路德从完全不同的角度宣扬主权。他的宗教改革神学主张剥夺天主教会的诸多权力，不仅是其教会权力，而且是按照任何现代定义都属于世俗的权力。路德认为，教会不应再被视为一个有形的、等级森严的机构，教会应该是坚持正确教义的地方教会的无形联合体。因此，天主教会拥有大片土地，对其征税、防卫、并对其进行司法管理变得不再合法；天主教会的主教在王公和国王手下担任世俗职务不再合法；教皇也不能借助开除教籍的权力废黜世俗统治者；最重要的是，神圣罗马帝国皇帝不再能合法地强制天主教统一。教会和以教会名义行事的人将不再行使政治或经济权力。那么，谁会接过这些被放弃的权力呢？领地王公。政治哲学家费吉斯（J.N. Figgis）写道：“通过摧毁教会的独立性及其对域外公众舆论的控制，国家内部统一的最后一个障碍被清除了。”正是这一愿景在威斯特伐利亚取得了胜利。

Luther’s political theology explained all of this. He taught that under God’s authority, two orders with two forms of government existed. “The realm of the spirit” was the order in which Christ was related to the soul of the believer. The realm of the world was the order of secular society, where civil authorities ran governmental institutions through law and coercion. Both realms furthered the good of believers, but in different senses; they were to be separately organized. Leaders of the church would perform spiritual duties; princes, kings and magistrates would perform temporal ones. Freed from the power of the pope and the Catholic Church, having appropriated temporal powers within their realm, princes were now effectively sovereign. In that era, princes even exercised considerable control over Protestant churches, often appointing their regional leaders, as described by the doctrine of “Erastianism.” Though neither Luther nor other Protestant reformers discussed the doctrine of sovereignty in any detail, they prescribed for princes all of its substance. Again, Figgis:

路德的政治神学解释了这一切。他教导说，在上帝的权威之下，存在着两种秩序和两种政府形式。“属灵的领域”是与基督及信徒的灵魂相关的秩序。“世界的领域”是世俗社会的秩序，公民当局通过法律和强制力管理政府机构。这两个领域都能增进信徒的益处，但意义不同；它们应该分开组织。教会领袖履行属灵的职责，而王公、国王和地方官则履行世俗的职责。从教皇和天主教会的权力中解脱出来，王公们在自己的领地内掌握了世俗的权力，他们现在实际上拥有主权。在那个时代，王公甚至对新教教会行使了相当大的控制权，经常任命他们的地区领袖，正如“埃拉斯都主义”学说所描述的那样。虽然路德和其他新教改革者都没有详细讨论主权学说，但他们为王公们规定了主权学说的所有实质内容。同样，菲吉斯说：

```
The unity and universality and essential rightness of the sovereign territorial State, and the denial of every extra-territorial or independent communal form of life, are Luther’s lasting contribution to politics. (91)

区域性的主权国家的统一性、普遍性和本质正确性，以及对一切领土外的或独立的公共生活形式的否定，是路德对政治的持久贡献。(91)
```

Other early modern philosophers, of course, espoused the doctrine of sovereignty explicitly, and are thus more familiarly associated with it. French philosopher Jean Bodin was the first European philosopher to treat the concept extensively. His concept of souveraineté featured as a central concept in his work, De la république, which he wrote in 1576, during a time when France was sundered by civil war between Calvinist Huguenots and the Catholic monarchy. He viewed the problem of order as central and did not think that it could be solved through outdated medieval notions of a segmented society, but only through a concept in which rulers and ruled were integrated into a single, unitary body politic that was above any other human law, and was in fact the source of human law. This concept was sovereignty. Only a supreme authority within a territory could strengthen a fractured community.

当然，现代早期的其他哲学家也明确支持主权学说，因此他们与主权学说的联系更为人们所熟知。法国哲学家让·博丹是第一个广泛论述这一概念的欧洲哲学家。他的著作《共和国论》（De la république）将主权概念作为一个核心概念，该书写于1576年，当时法国正处于加尔文主义胡格诺派与天主教君主政体之间的内战之中。他将秩序问题视为核心问题，认为这个问题无法通过过时的中世纪社会分割概念来解决，而只能通过一个概念来解决，在这个概念中，统治者和被统治者被整合为一个单一的、统一的政治体，这个政治体凌驾于任何其他人类法律之上，这个政治体实际上是人类法律的源泉。这个概念就是主权。只有领土内的最高权力机构才能巩固一个支离破碎的社会。

To be sure, Bodin thought that the body that exercised sovereignty was bound by natural and divine law, though no human law could judge or appeal to it. More curiously, he also thought that sovereignty rightly exercised would respect customary and property rights. It is not clear how such a restraint was to be reconciled with the supreme status of sovereign authority. Possibly, Bodin thought that 1such rights were to be features of a legal regime which was itself sovereign with respect to other authorities. Indeed, he also thought the form of government that exercised sovereign powers could legitimately vary among monarchy, aristocracy and democracy, though he preferred monarchy. Whatever the sovereign body looked like, though, it was not subject to any external human law or authority within its territory. F.H. Hinsley writes:

当然，博丹认为，行使主权的机构受自然法和神圣法的约束，尽管任何人类法律都不能对其进行审判或上诉。更奇怪的是，他还认为对主权的正确行使应该尊重习俗和财产权。不清楚如何将这种约束与主权的至高无上地位相协调。也许，博丹认为这些权利是法律制度的特征，而法律制度本身相对于其他权力机构是拥有主权的。事实上，他还认为行使主权权力的政府形式可以合法地在君主制、贵族制和民主制之间变化，但他更倾向于君主制。不过，无论主权机构是什么样子，它在其领土内都不受任何外部人类法律或权威的制约。F.H. Hinsley写道：

At a time when it had become imperative that the conflict between rulers and ruled should be terminated, [Bodin] realized — and it was an impressive intellectual feat — that the conflict would be solved only if it was possible both to establish the existence of a necessarily unrestricted ruling power and to distinguish this power from an absolutism that was free to disregard all laws and regulations. He did this by founding both the legality of this power and the wisdom of observing the limitations which hedged its proper use upon the nature of the body politic as a political society comprising both ruler and ruled — and his statement of sovereignty was the necessary, only possible, result (124–125).

当统治者与被统治者之间的冲突必须停止的时候，\[博丹\]意识到——这是一个令人印象深刻的思想壮举——只有既能确立必然存在的不受限制的统治权力，又能将这种权力与可以无视一切法律和规则的专制主义区分开来，这种冲突才能得到解决。他做到了这一点，经由确立了这种权力的合法性，又明智地遵守了对其的限制，这种限制是建立在政治体的本质之上，政治体是一个由统治者和被统治者共同组成的政治社会——而他关于主权的论述是必要的、唯一可能的结果（124-125）。

An important exploration of Bodin’s thought is also Daniel Lee’s book, The Right of Sovereignty (2021), which argues that Bodin did not view sovereignty as an unconstrained power to command in the fashion of modern legal positivism but rather as a normative authority bound by natural law, the law of nations, and its contracts. Bodin’s “statement of sovereignty” is the first systematic one in modern European philosophy, and thus deserves a landmark status.

丹尼尔·李（Daniel Lee）的著作《主权的权利》（2021 年）也是对博丹思想的重要探索，该书认为博丹并没有像现代法律实证主义那样将主权视为一种不受约束的命令权，而是一种受自然法、万国法以及国家间条约约束的规范性权威。博丹的“主权论述”是现代欧洲哲学中第一个系统性论述，因此具有里程碑式的地位。

The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes also wrote during a time of civil war and also arrived at the notion of sovereignty as a solution. For Hobbes, the people established sovereign authority through a contract in which they transferred all of their rights to the Leviathan, which represented the abstract notion of the state. The will of the Leviathan reigned supreme and represented the will of all those who had alienated their rights to it. Like Bodin’s sovereign, Hobbes’ Leviathan was above the law, a mortal god unbound by any constitution or contractual obligations with any external party. Like Bodin, Hobbes also thought the sovereign to be accountable to God and most likely to the natural law in some form. Otherwise, though, law was the command of the sovereign ruler, emanating from his will, and the obligation to obey it absolute.

英国哲学家托马斯·霍布斯（Thomas Hobbes）也在内战时期著书立说，也提出了主权的概念作为解决方案。在霍布斯看来，人民通过契约建立主权权威，在契约中，他们将自己的所有权利转让给代表国家抽象概念的 “利维坦”。利维坦的意志至高无上，代表了所有将权利转让给利维坦的人的意志。与博丹笔下的主权者一样，霍布斯笔下的利维坦凌驾于法律之上，是一个不受任何宪法或任何外部契约义务约束的凡人之神。与博丹一样，霍布斯也认为主权者要对上帝负责，而且很可能以某种形式对自然法负责。除此之外，法律是主权者的命令，源于主权者的意志，服从法律的义务是绝对的。

Both Bodin and Hobbes argued for sovereignty as supreme authority. The concept continues to prevail as the presumption of political rule in states throughout the globe today, including ones where the sovereign body of law institutes limited government and civil rights for individuals. Over the centuries, new notions of the holders of sovereignty have evolved. Rousseau, far different from Bodin or Hobbes, saw the collective people within a state as the sovereign, ruling through their general will. In constitutional government, it is the people ruling through a body of law that is sovereign. That is the version that commands legitimacy most commonly in the world today.

博丹和霍布斯都主张主权是最高权威。这一概念作为政治统治的假定在当今世界各国继续盛行，包括那些由主权法律机构建立有限政府并赋予个人公民权利的国家。几个世纪以来，关于主权拥有者的新概念不断演变。卢梭与博丹或霍布斯大相径庭，他将国家中的人民集体视为主权者，通过他们的公意（general will）进行统治。在由宪法规定的政府中，人民通过法律体系进行统治才是主权。这也是当今世界最常见的具有合法性的版本。

Yet versions of sovereignty evocative of Hobbes’ and Bodin’s have carried forth into the twentieth century. Explicitly invoking both of these philosophers was the early twentieth century German philosopher and jurist Carl Schmitt, for instance. His book of 1922 opens with the line, “Sovereign is he who decides on the exception” (trans. G. Schwab, 1985). Schmitt thought that the sovereign was above any constitutional law and ought to be able to “make a decision” on behalf of the good of the state during a time of emergency. He had little respect for liberal constitutionalism, which he thought wholly inadequate to contain the power struggle that politics involves. By and large, there is little indicating that, at least in this work, Schmitt thought the sovereign to be bound by divine law or natural law. The liberal constitutionalism of Weimar Germany was his chief piece of evidence for this conviction; during the 1930s he fervently supported the National Socialist regime, one whose emergency powers were just those that he thought necessary.

然而，霍布斯和博丹关于主权的说法一直延续到二十世纪。例如，二十世纪初的德国哲学家和法学家卡尔·施米特就明确援引了这两位哲学家的观点。他在1922年出版的书中开宗明义地写道：“主权者是在例外状态做决定的人。”（转引自G.Schwab，1985年）。施米特认为，主权者凌驾于任何宪法之上，应该能够在紧急状态下代表国家利益“做出决定”。施米特不太尊重自由宪政，他认为自由宪政完全不足以遏制政治所涉及的权力斗争。总的来说，至少在这部著作中，几乎没有迹象表明施米特认为主权者受神圣法或自然法的约束。魏玛德国的自由宪政是他这一信念的主要证据；在20世纪30年代，他狂热地支持国家社会主义政权，该政权的紧急权力正是他认为必要的权力。（20241105修改）

## 主权国家的限制：理论与实践

The rise and global expansion of sovereignty, described and even lauded by political philosophers, amounts to one of the most formidable and successful political trends in modern times. But from its earliest days, sovereignty has also met with both doubters and qualified supporters, many of whom have regarded any body of law’s claim to sovereign status as a form of idolatry, sometimes as a carapace behind which rulers carry out cruelties and injustices free from legitimate outside scrutiny. It was indeed after the Holocaust that meaningful legal and institutional circumscriptions of sovereignty in fact arose, many of which have come to abridge the rights of sovereign states quite significantly. The two most prominent curtailments are conventions on human rights and European integration.

主权的崛起和在全球范围内的扩张被政治哲学家们描述甚至赞美，成为现代最强大和最成功的政治趋势之一。但是，主权从一开始就既有质疑者，也有合格的支持者，其中许多人认为任何法律体系对主权地位的主张都是一种偶像崇拜，有时甚至是统治者实施残酷和不公正行为的外衣，而不受合法的外部监督。事实上，正是在大屠杀之后，才出现了对主权的有意义的法律和制度性限制，其中许多限制对主权国家的权利造成了相当大的损害。其中最突出的两项限制是人权公约和欧洲一体化公约。

It was in 1948 that the vast majority of states signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, committing themselves to respect over 30 separate rights for individuals. As it was not a legally binding declaration and contained no enforcement provisions, the declaration left states’ sovereignty intact, but it was a first step towards tethering them to international, universal obligations regarding their internal affairs. Over decades, these human rights would come to enjoy ever stronger legal status. One of the most robust human rights conventions, one that indeed curtails sovereignty, even if mildly, through its arbitration mechanisms, is the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, formed in 1950. Roughly contemporaneous, signed on December 9, 1948, was the Genocide Convention, committing signing states to refrain from and punish genocide. Then, in the mid-1960’s, two covenants — the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights — legally bound most of the world’s states to respecting the human rights of their people. Again, the signatories’ constitutional authority remained largely intact, since they would not allow any of these commitments to infringe upon their sovereignty. Subsequent human rights covenants, also signed by the vast majority of the world’s states, contained similar reservations.

1948 年，绝大多数国家签署了《世界人权宣言》，承诺尊重 30 多项独立的个人权利。由于该宣言并不具有法律约束力，也不包含任何执行条款，因此国家主权不受影响，但这是将国家与有关其内部事务的国际普遍义务联系在一起的第一步。几十年来，这些人权的法律地位日益加强。1950 年制定的《欧洲保护人权与基本自由公约》是最强有力的人权公约之一，它通过仲裁机制对主权进行了限制，哪怕是轻微的限制。与此大致同时，1948 年 12 月 9 日签署的《灭绝种族罪公约》要求签署国承诺不实施并惩罚灭绝种族行为。随后，在 20 世纪 60 年代中期，两项公约--《公民权利和政治权利国际公约》和《经济、社会、文化权利国际公约》--从法律上约束世界上大多数国家尊重本国人民的人权。同样，签署国的宪法权威在很大程度上保持不变，因为它们不允许任何这些承诺侵犯其主权。世界上绝大多数国家签署的后续人权公约都包含类似的保留条款。

Only a practice of human rights backed up by military enforcement or robust judicial procedures would circumscribe sovereignty in a serious way. Progress in this direction began to occur after the Cold War through a historic revision of the Peace of Westphalia, one that curtails a norm strongly advanced by its treaties — non-intervention. In a series of several episodes beginning in 1990, the United Nations or another international organization has endorsed a political action, usually involving military force, that the broad consensus of states would have previously regarded as illegitimate interference in internal affairs. The episodes have involved the approval of military operations to remedy an injustice within the boundaries of a state or the outside administration of domestic matters like police operations. Unlike peacekeeping operations during the Cold War, the operations have usually lacked the consent of the government of the target state. They have occurred in Iraq, the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, Cambodia, Liberia, Libya and elsewhere. Although the legitimacy and wisdom of individual interventions is often contested among states — the U.S. bombing of Iraq in December 1999 and NATO’s intervention in Kosovo, for instance, failed to elicit U.N. Security Council endorsement, as did the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 — the broad practice of intervention is likely to continue to enjoy broad endorsement within the U.N. Security Council and other international organizations.

只有以军事执法或强有力的司法程序为后盾的人权实践，才会以严肃的方式限制主权。冷战后，通过对《威斯特伐利亚和约》的历史性修订，这一方向开始取得进展，该修订限制了其条约大力推进的一项准则--不干涉。在 1990 年开始的一系列事件中，联合国或其他国际组织批准了一项政治行动，通常涉及军事力量，而在此之前，各国的广泛共识会将其视为对内部事务的非法干涉。这些事件涉及批准军事行动，以纠正一国境内的不公正现象，或对警察行动等国内事务进行外部管理。与冷战时期的维和行动不同，这些行动通常未征得目标国政府的同意。这些行动发生在伊拉克、前南斯拉夫、波斯尼亚、科索沃、索马里、卢旺达、海地、柬埔寨、利比里亚、利比亚和其他地方。尽管各国对个别干预行动的合法性和明智性常常存在争议--例如，1999 年 12 月美国轰炸伊拉克和北约干预科索沃的行动都未能获得联合国安理会的认可，2003 年美国入侵伊拉克的行动也是如此--但广泛的干预行动很可能会继续得到联合国安理会和其他国际组织的广泛认可。

An explicit call to revise the concept of sovereignty so as to allow for internationally sanctioned intervention arose with The Responsibility to Protect, a document written and produced in 2001 by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, a commission that the Government of Canada convened at the behest of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. The document proposes a strong revision of the classical conception by which sovereignty involves a “responsibility to protect” on the part of a state towards its own citizens, a responsibility that outsiders may assume when a state perpetrates massive injustice or cannot protect its own citizens. Responsibility to Protect has garnered wide international attention and serves as a manifesto for a concept of sovereignty that is non-absolute and conditional upon outside obligations.

2001 年，加拿大政府在联合国秘书长科菲-安南的授意下成立了干预和国家主权国际委员会，该委员会撰写并编写了《保护的责任》文件，明确呼吁修改主权概念，以便允许国际认可的干预。该文件对传统概念提出了强有力的修正，即主权涉及国家对本国公民的 “保护责任”，当国家实施大规模不公正行为或无法保护本国公民时，外人可以承担这一责任。保护责任 "引起了国际社会的广泛关注，并成为一种非绝对的、以外部义务为条件的主权概念的宣言。

The other way in which sovereignty is being circumscribed is through European integration. This idea also arose in reaction to the Holocaust, a calamity that many European leaders attributed at least in part to the sovereign state’s lack of accountability. Historically, the most enthusiastic supporters of European integration have indeed come from Catholic Christian Democratic parties, whose ideals are rooted in medieval Christendom, where at least in theory, no leader was sovereign and all leaders were accountable to a universal set of values. In the modern language of human rights and democracy, they echo Pope Innocent X’s excoriation of the Peace of Westphalia.

另一种限制主权的方式是欧洲一体化。许多欧洲领导人将这场灾难至少部分归咎于主权国家缺乏责任感。从历史上看，欧洲一体化最热情的支持者确实来自天主教基督教民主党，他们的理想植根于中世纪的基督教世界，在那里，至少在理论上，没有任何领导人是主权国家，所有领导人都要对一套普世价值观负责。用现代的人权和民主语言来说，它们与教皇英诺森十世对《威斯特伐利亚和约》的抨击如出一辙。

European integration began in 1950, when six states formed the European Coal and Steel Community in the Treaty of Paris. The community established joint international authority over the coal and steel industries of these six countries, entailing executive control through a permanent bureaucracy and a decision-making Council of Ministers composed of foreign ministers of each state. This same model was expanded to a general economic zone in the Treaty of Rome in 1957. It was enhanced by a judicial body, the European Court of Justice, and a legislature, the European Parliament, a directly elected Europe-wide body. Over time, European integration has widened, as the institution now consists of twenty-seven members, and deepened, as it did in the 1991 Maastricht Treaty, which expanded the institution’s powers and reconfigured it as the European Union. Far from a replacement for states, the European Union rather “pools” important aspects of their sovereignty into a “supranational” institution in which their freedom of action is constrained (Keohane & Hoffman 1991). They are no longer absolutely sovereign. In recent years, European integration has continued to advance in important respects. On December 1, 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon came into full force, pooling sovereignty further by strengthening the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, creating a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to represent a unified European Union position, and making the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Human Rights legally binding. However, strains on European integration have emerged in recent years as well. A treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was signed by the European Union’s member states in 2004, but referendums in France and the Netherlands in 2005 rejected it and prevented its ratification. Then, in 2016, a referendum in the United Kingdom resulted in a victory for the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union, popularly known as “Brexit.”

欧洲一体化始于 1950 年，当时六个国家根据《巴黎条约》成立了欧洲煤钢共同体。共同体对这六个国家的煤炭和钢铁工业建立了共同的国际权威，通过一个常设官僚机构和一个由各国外交部长组成的决策部长理事会进行行政控制。1957 年的《罗马条约》将这一模式扩大到一般经济区。一个司法机构--欧洲法院和一个立法机构--欧洲议会（欧洲范围内直接选举产生的机构）加强了这一模式。随着时间的推移，欧洲一体化的范围不断扩大，目前该机构由 27 个成员组成；一体化的程度也不断加深，1991 年的《马斯特里赫特条约》扩大了该机构的权力，并将其重组为欧洲联盟。欧洲联盟远非取代国家，而是将国家主权的重要方面 “集中 ”到一个 “超国家 ”机构中，国家的行动自由受到限制（Keohane & Hoffman，1991 年）。它们不再拥有绝对主权。近年来，欧洲一体化在一些重要方面继续向前推进。2009 年 12 月 1 日，《里斯本条约》全面生效，通过加强部长理事会和欧洲议会进一步集中了主权，设立了欧盟外交与安全政策高级代表来代表欧盟的统一立场，并使《欧盟基本人权宪章》具有法律约束力。然而，近年来欧洲一体化也出现了一些问题。2004 年，欧盟成员国签署了制定《欧洲宪法》的条约，但 2005 年法国和荷兰的全民公决否决了该条约，并阻止了条约的批准。随后，2016 年英国公投以英国退出欧盟（俗称 “脱欧”）的胜利告终。

This circumscription of the sovereign state, through international norms and supranational institutions, finds a parallel in contemporary philosophers who attack the notion of absolute sovereignty. Their thought is not entirely new, for even in early modern times, philosophers like Hugo Grotius, Alberico Gentili, and Francisco Suarez, though they accepted the state as a legitimate institution, thought that its authority ought to be limited, not absolute. The cruel prince, for instance, could be subject to a disciplining action from neighboring princes that is much like contemporary notions of humanitarian intervention.

这种通过国际规范和超国家机构对主权国家的限定，在攻击绝对主权概念的当代哲学家那里找到了相似之处。他们的思想并非全新，因为即使在近代早期，雨果-格劳秀斯（Hugo Grotius）、阿尔贝里科-根蒂利（Alberico Gentili）和弗朗西斯科-苏亚雷斯（Francisco Suarez）等哲学家虽然接受国家是合法机构，但认为其权力应该是有限的，而非绝对的。例如，残暴的王子可能会受到邻国王子的惩戒，这与当代的人道主义干预概念非常相似。

Two of the most prominent attacks on sovereignty by political philosophers since World War II came in the 1950s from Bertrand de Jouvenel and Jacques Maritain. In his prominent work of 1957, Sovereignty: An Inquiry Into the Political Good, Jouvenel acknowledges that sovereignty is an important attribute of modern political authority, needed to quell disputes within the state and to muster cooperation in defense against outsiders. But he roundly decries the modern concept of sovereignty, which creates a power who is above the rules, a power whose decrees are to be considered legitimate simply because they emanate from his will. To Jouvenel, sovereignty reached its peak in Hobbes, in whose “horrific conception everything comes back to means of constraint, which enable the sovereign to issue rights and dictate laws in any way he pleases. But these means of constraint are themselves but a fraction of the social forces concentrated in the hand of the sovereign” (197). Despite their differences over the locus and form of sovereignty, subsequent thinkers like Locke, Pufendorf, and Rousseau “were to feel the lure of this mechanically perfect construction” (198). This was “the hour of sovereignty in itself,” writes Jouvenel, the existence of which “hardly anyone would thenceforward have the hardihood to deny” (198).

自第二次世界大战以来，政治哲学家对主权的两次最突出的攻击来自 20 世纪 50 年代的贝特朗-德-儒弗内尔和雅克-马里坦。在 1957 年出版的著名著作《主权》（Sovereignty： 朱维纳尔承认，主权是现代政治权威的一个重要属性，是平息国家内部争端和凝聚合作抵御外来者的需要。但他严厉批评了现代主权概念，认为它创造了一种凌驾于规则之上的权力，这种权力的法令仅仅因为出自其意志而被视为合法。在儒弗内尔看来，主权在霍布斯那里达到了顶峰，在霍布斯的 "可怕概念中，一切都归结为制约手段，这使得主权者可以随心所欲地发布权利和制定法律。但这些制约手段本身只是集中在主权者手中的社会力量的一小部分"（197）。尽管他们在主权的定位和形式上存在分歧，但洛克、普芬多夫和卢梭等后来的思想家 “都感受到了这种机械完美构造的诱惑”（198）。茹维内尔写道，这是 “主权本身的时刻”，“此后几乎没有人敢否认它的存在”（198）。

As his description of Hobbes intimates, Jouvenel views early modern absolute sovereignty with great alarm. “[I]t is the idea itself which is dangerous,” he writes (198). But rather than calling for the concept to be abrogated, he holds that sovereignty must be channeled so that sovereign authority wills nothing but what is legitimate. Far from being defined by the sovereign, morality has an independent validity. Appealing to the perspective of “Christian thinkers,” he argues that “there are . . . wills which are just and wills which are unjust” (201). “Authority,” then, “carries with it the obligation to command the thing that should be commanded” (201). This was the understanding of authority held by the ancien regime, where effective advisers to the monarch could channel his efforts towards the common good. What can channel the sovereign will today? Jouvenel seems to doubt that judicial or constitutional design is alone enough. Rather, he places his hope in the shared moral concepts of the citizenry, which act as a constraint upon the choices of the sovereign.

正如他对霍布斯的描述所暗示的那样，茹维内尔对现代早期的绝对主权感到非常震惊。他写道：“危险的是理念本身”（198）。但他并没有要求废除这一概念，而是认为主权必须加以引导，使主权权威只允许合法的东西。道德远非由主权界定，而是具有独立的有效性。他从 “基督教思想家 ”的角度出发，认为 “有......正义的意志，也有不正义的意志”（201）。因此，“权威”“带有命令应该命令的事物的义务”（201）。这就是古代政体对权力的理解，在古代政体中，君主的有效顾问可以引导君主为共同利益而努力。今天，什么才能引导君主的意志呢？儒弗内尔似乎怀疑仅靠司法或宪法设计是不够的。相反，他把希望寄托在公民的共同道德观念上，这些观念对君主的选择起着制约作用。

In Chapter Two of his enduring work of 1951, Man and the State, Jacques Maritain shows little sympathy for sovereignty at all, not even the qualified sympathy of Jouvenel:

雅克-马里坦（Jacques Maritain）在 1951 年出版的经久不衰的著作《人与国家》（Man and the State）的第二章中，对主权几乎没有表示任何同情，甚至连尤韦内尔（Jouvenel）那种有条件的同情也没有：

It is my contention that political philosophy must get rid of the word, as well as the concept, of Sovereignty:-not because it is an antiquated concept, or by virtue of a sociological-juridical theory of “objective law”; and not only because the concept of Sovereignty creates insuperable difficulties and theoretical entanglements in the field of international law; but because, considered in its genuine meaning, and in the perspective of the proper scientific realm to which it belongs — political philosophy — this concept is intrinsically wrong and bound to mislead us if we keep on using it — assuming that it has been too long and too largely accepted to be permissibly rejected, and unaware of the false connotations that are inherent in it (29–30).

我的论点是，政治哲学必须摆脱 “主权 ”这个词以及这个概念： -不是因为它是一个过时的概念，也不是因为 “客观法 ”的社会学-法学理论；不仅是因为主权概念在国际法领域造成了难以克服的困难和理论上的纠缠；而且还因为，从其真正的含义以及从其所属的适当科学领域--政治哲学--的角度来看，如果我们继续使用这一概念--假定它已被接受得太久、太普遍，不允许加以摒弃，并且没有意识到其固有的错误内涵，那么这一概念在本质上就是错误的，而且必然会误导我们（29-30）。

Bodin’s and Hobbes’ mistake was in conceiving of sovereignty as authority that the people permanently transferred and alienated to an external entity, here the monarch. Rather than representing the people and being accountable to it, the sovereign became a transcendent entity, holding the supreme and inalienable right to rule over the people, independently of them, rather than representing the people, accountable to them. Like Jouvenel, Maritain rues the exaltation of the sovereign’s will such that what is just is what serves his interest. This is idolatry. Any transfer of the authority of the body politic either to some part of itself or to some outside entity — the apparatus of the state, a monarch, or even the people — is illegitimate, for the validity of a government is rooted in its relationship to natural law. Sovereignty gives rise to three dysfunctionalities. First, its external dimension renders inconceivable international law and a world state, to both of which Maritain is highly sympathetic. Second, the internal dimension of sovereignty, the absolute power of the state over the body politic, results in centralism, not pluralism. Third, the supreme power of the sovereign state is contrary to the democratic notion of accountability.

博丹和霍布斯的错误在于将主权视为人民永久转移和让渡给外部实体（这里指君主）的权力。君主不是代表人民并对人民负责，而是成为一个超然的实体，拥有至高无上、不可剥夺的权利，可以统治人民，独立于人民之外，而不是代表人民并对人民负责。与儒弗内尔一样，马里坦也对君主的意志被推崇到正义就是符合其利益的地步表示遗憾。这是偶像崇拜。将政治体的权力转移给政治体自身的某个部分或某个外部实体--国家机器、君主甚至人民--都是不合法的，因为政府的有效性植根于它与自然法的关系。主权导致三个功能失调。首先，主权的外部维度使国际法和世界国家变得不可想象，而马里坦对这两者都深表同情。其次，主权的内部维度，即国家对政治体的绝对权力，导致了集权主义而非多元化。第三，主权国家的最高权力与民主的问责制概念背道而驰。

As a Catholic philosopher, Maritain’s arguments run similar to Christian philosophers of early modern Europe who criticized absolute sovereignty. Witnessing the rise of the formidable entity of the state, they sought to place limits on its power and authority. They are the ancestors of those who now demand limits on the state’s authority in the name of human rights, of the right to quell genocide and disaster and deliver relief from the outside, of an international criminal court, and of a supranational entity that assumes power of governance over economic, and now, maybe, military affairs.

作为天主教哲学家，马里坦的论点与近代欧洲早期批评绝对主权的基督教哲学家相似。他们目睹了国家这一强大实体的崛起，试图对其权力和权威加以限制。他们是那些现在以人权、平息种族灭绝和灾难以及从外部提供救济的权利、国际刑事法院以及对经济事务（现在可能还有军事事务）拥有管理权的超国家实体的名义要求限制国家权力的人的祖先。

The case for circumscribing sovereignty remains strong in the Catholic and other Christian traditions. Pope Benedict XVI made a case for the Responsibility to Protect, for instance, in his 2008 speech to the United Nations. In recent years, political philosophers in the liberal tradition have argued for the circumscription of sovereignty as well. Two examples are Thomas Pogge (1992, and 2008, 174–201) and Allen Buchanan (2004). Both accord sovereignty an important but not an absolute moral status, seeking to make room for possibilities such as humanitarian intervention approved by the United Nations and the more robust development of global institutions for fighting poverty.

在天主教和其他基督教传统中，限制主权的理由仍然很充分。例如，教皇本笃十六世在 2008 年向联合国发表的演讲中就提出了 “保护责任 ”的主张。近年来，自由主义传统中的政治哲学家也主张对主权进行限定。托马斯-波格（Thomas Pogge，1992 年；2008 年，174-201 页）和艾伦-布坎南（Allen Buchanan，2004 年）就是两个例子。他们都赋予主权重要但非绝对的道德地位，试图为各种可能性留出空间，如联合国批准的人道主义干预以及更有力地发展消除贫困的全球机构。
