# 亚里士多德《政治学》的特点和问题

The work which has come down to us under the title POLITIKA appears to be less an integrated treatise than a loosely related collection of essays or lectures on various topics in political philosophy, which may have been compiled by a later editor rather than by Aristotle. The following topics are discussed in the eight books:
I Naturalness of the city-state and of the household
II Critique of ostensibly best constitutions
III General theory of constitutions
IV Inferior constitutions
V Preservation and destruction of constitutions
VI Further discussion of democracy and oligarchy
VII–VIII Unfinished outline of the best constitution


这部以《政治学》为名流传下来的作品，与其说是一部完整的论著，不如说是一部内部联系松散的论文集或讲座集，内容涉及政治哲学的各种主题，可能是由一位后来的编辑而不是亚里士多德编纂的。《政治学》的八卷讨论了以下主题：
I 城邦和家庭的自然性
II 对表面上的最佳政体的批判
III 政体的一般理论
IV 低劣政体类型
V 政体的保存与毁灭
VI 民主制和寡头制的进一步讨论
VII-VIII 未完成的最佳政体纲要


This ordering of the books reflects, very roughly, the program for the study of constitutions which concludes the Nicomachean Ethics:


这种排序方式大致反映了《尼各马可伦理学》结尾处的政体研究计划：


First, then, if any particular point has been treated well by those who have gone before us, we must try to review it; then from the constitutions that have been collected we must try to see what it is that preserves and destroys each of the constitutions, and for what reasons some city-states are well governed and others the reverse. For when these things have been examined, we will perhaps better understand what sort of constitution is best, and how each is structured, and which laws and customs it uses. Let us then begin our discussion. \[尼各马可伦理学X.9.1181b15–23\]


首先，如果我们的前人已经很好地处理过某一问题，我们就必须尝试回顾一下他们的做法；然后，我们必须从已经观察到的政体中，尝试找出是什么保存和破坏了每一种政体，以及出于何种原因，一些城邦治理得很好，而另一些城邦则相反。通过这样的考察，我们或许就能更好地理解哪种政体是最好的，每种政体是如何构建的，它采用了哪些法律和习俗。现在，让我们开始探讨吧。\[尼各马可伦理学X.9.1181b15–23\]


However, scholars have raised several general problems concerning the Politics and its place in Aristotle’s philosophical system. Four issues are especially noteworthy: How did Aristotle intend for the Politics to be organized? In what order did he write the different books within the Politics? Is the work considered as a whole consistent? How is the Politics related to Aristotle’s ethical treatises?


然而，学者们就《政治学》及其在亚里士多德哲学体系中的地位提出了几个普遍性问题。其中有四个问题尤其引人注目：亚里士多德是如何编排组织《政治学》这部作品的？他是按照什么顺序撰写《政治学》各卷的？这部作品作为一个整体是否具有内在一致性？《政治学》与亚里士多德的伦理学著作有何关联？
