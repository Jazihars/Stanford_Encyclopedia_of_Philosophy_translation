# 亚里士多德《政治学》的特点和问题

The work which has come down to us under the title POLITIKA appears to be less an integrated treatise than a loosely related collection of essays or lectures on various topics in political philosophy, which may have been compiled by a later editor rather than by Aristotle. The following topics are discussed in the eight books:
I Naturalness of the city-state and of the household
II Critique of ostensibly best constitutions
III General theory of constitutions
IV Inferior constitutions
V Preservation and destruction of constitutions
VI Further discussion of democracy and oligarchy
VII–VIII Unfinished outline of the best constitution


这部以《政治学》为名流传下来的作品，与其说是一部完整的论著，不如说是一部内部联系松散的论文集或讲座集，内容涉及政治哲学的各种主题，可能是由一位后来的编辑而不是亚里士多德编纂的。《政治学》的八卷讨论了以下主题：
I 城邦和家庭的自然性
II 对表面上的最佳政体的批判
III 政体的一般理论
IV 低劣政体类型
V 政体的保存与毁灭
VI 民主制和寡头制的进一步讨论
VII-VIII 未完成的最佳政体纲要


This ordering of the books reflects, very roughly, the program for the study of constitutions which concludes the Nicomachean Ethics:


这种排序方式大致反映了《尼各马可伦理学》结尾处的政体研究计划：


First, then, if any particular point has been treated well by those who have gone before us, we must try to review it; then from the constitutions that have been collected we must try to see what it is that preserves and destroys each of the constitutions, and for what reasons some city-states are well governed and others the reverse. For when these things have been examined, we will perhaps better understand what sort of constitution is best, and how each is structured, and which laws and customs it uses. Let us then begin our discussion. \[尼各马可伦理学X.9.1181b15–23\]


首先，如果我们的前人已经很好地处理过某一问题，我们就必须尝试回顾一下他们的做法；然后，我们必须从已经观察到的政体中，尝试找出是什么保存和破坏了每一种政体，以及出于何种原因，一些城邦治理得很好，而另一些城邦则相反。通过这样的考察，我们或许就能更好地理解哪种政体是最好的，每种政体是如何构建的，它采用了哪些法律和习俗。现在，让我们开始探讨吧。\[尼各马可伦理学X.9.1181b15–23\]


However, scholars have raised several general problems concerning the Politics and its place in Aristotle’s philosophical system. Four issues are especially noteworthy: How did Aristotle intend for the Politics to be organized? In what order did he write the different books within the Politics? Is the work considered as a whole consistent? How is the Politics related to Aristotle’s ethical treatises?


然而，学者们就《政治学》及其在亚里士多德哲学体系中的地位提出了几个普遍性问题。其中有四个问题尤其引人注目：亚里士多德是如何编排组织《政治学》这部作品的？他是按照什么顺序撰写《政治学》各卷的？这部作品作为一个整体是否具有内在一致性？《政治学》与亚里士多德的伦理学著作有何关联？


(1) **The intended organization of the Politics** Some scholars (including W. L. Newman) have questioned the traditional ordering of the eight books of the Politics, arguing that the discussion of the best constitution (books VII–VIII) should follow directly after book III. Indeed, book III concludes with a transition to a discussion of the best constitution (although this may be due to a later editor). However, cross-references between various passages of the Politics indicate that books IV–V–VI form a connected series, as do books VII–VIII, but these series do not refer to each other. Nonetheless, both series refer back to book III which in turn refers to book I. Moreover, book II refers back to book I and refers forward to both series. With some oversimplification, then, the Politics is comparable to a tree trunk supporting two separate branches: the root system is I, the trunk is II–III, and the branches are IV–V–VI and VII–VIII. (The summary at the end of Nicomachean Ethics X.9 describes only the visible part of the tree.) All modern critical editions and most translations and commentaries follow the traditional ordering of the books. Noteworthy exceptions are Newman’s commentary and Simpson’s translation, which follow the revised ordering: I—II—III—VII—VIII—IV—V—VI.


(1)**《政治学》的预定编排方式** 一些学者（包括 W.L.纽曼）对《政治学》八卷书的传统排序方式提出质疑，认为对最佳宪法的讨论（第七卷至第八卷）应直接放在第三卷之后。事实上，第三卷最后过渡到了对最佳宪法的讨论（尽管这可能是后来的编辑造成的）。然而，《政治学》中不同段落之间的相互参照表明，第四至第六卷与第七至第八卷构成了一个相连的系列，但这两个系列并不相互参照。然而，这两个系列都回溯到第三卷，而第三卷又回溯到第一卷，此外，第二卷回溯到第一卷，并向前回溯到这两个系列。因此，略微简化一下，《政治学》就好比是一棵树的主干，支撑着两个独立的分支：根系是第一卷，主干是第二卷至第三卷，分支是第四卷至第六卷和第七卷至第八卷。(尼各马可伦理学》X.9 结尾的摘要只描述了树的可见部分）。所有现代批判性版本以及大多数翻译和注释都遵循传统的书籍顺序。值得注意的例外是纽曼的注释和辛普森的译本，它们遵循修订后的顺序： 一-二-三-四-五-六。


(2) The order of composition This problem concerns the order in which the books were actually written. If they were composed at very different dates, they might represent discordant stages in the development of Aristotle’s political philosophy. For example, Werner Jaeger argued that books VII–VIII contain a youthful utopianism, motivating Aristotle to emulate his teacher Plato in erecting “an ideal state by logical construction.” In contrast, books IV–VI are based on “sober empirical study.” Other scholars have seen a more pragmatic, even Machiavellian approach to politics in books IV–VI. A difficulty for this interpretation is that in book IV Aristotle regards the business of constructing ideal constitutions as perfectly compatible with that of addressing actual political problems. Although much ink has been spilled since Jaeger attempted to discern different chronological strata in the Politics, it has resulted in no clear scholarly consensus. Because there is no explicit evidence of the dates at which the various books of the Politics were written, argument has turned on alleged discrepancies between different passages.


(2) 创作顺序 这个问题涉及这两本书的实际写作顺序。如果这两本书的写作时间大相径庭，那么它们可能代表亚里士多德政治哲学发展的不和谐阶段。例如，维尔纳-耶格尔（Werner Jaeger）认为，第七至第八卷包含了一种年轻的乌托邦主义，促使亚里士多德效仿他的老师柏拉图，“通过逻辑建构建立一个理想国”。相比之下，第四至第六卷则以 “冷静的经验研究 ”为基础。其他学者认为，第四至第六卷中的政治更加务实，甚至是马基雅维利式的政治。这种解释的难点在于，在第四卷中，亚里士多德认为构建理想宪法的工作与解决实际政治问题的工作是完全一致的。尽管自从耶格尔试图辨别《政治学》中的不同年代层以来，人们已经花费了大量笔墨，但却没有形成明确的学术共识。由于没有明确的证据证明《政治学》各卷的写作时间，因此争论的焦点集中在不同段落之间的所谓差异上。
