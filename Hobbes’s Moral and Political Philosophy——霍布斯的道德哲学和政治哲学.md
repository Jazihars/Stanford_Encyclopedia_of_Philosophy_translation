The 17th Century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes is now widely regarded as one of a handful of truly great political philosophers, whose masterwork Leviathan rivals in significance the political writings of Plato, Aristotle, Locke, Rousseau, Kant, and Rawls. Hobbes is famous for his early and elaborate development of what has come to be known as “social contract theory”, the method of justifying political principles or arrangements by appeal to the agreement that would be made among suitably situated rational, free, and equal persons. He is infamous for having used the social contract method to arrive at the astonishing conclusion that we ought to submit to the authority of an absolute—undivided and unlimited—sovereign power. While his methodological innovation had a profound constructive impact on subsequent work in political philosophy, his substantive conclusions have served mostly as a foil for the development of more palatable philosophical positions. Hobbes’s moral philosophy has been less influential than his political philosophy, in part because that theory is too ambiguous to have garnered any general consensus as to its content. Most scholars have taken Hobbes to have affirmed some sort of personal relativism or subjectivism; but views that Hobbes espoused divine command theory, virtue ethics, rule egoism, or a form of projectivism also find support in Hobbes’s texts and among scholars. Because Hobbes held that “the true doctrine of the Lawes of Nature is the true Morall philosophie”, differences in interpretation of Hobbes’s moral philosophy can be traced to differing understandings of the status and operation of Hobbes’s “laws of nature”, which laws will be discussed below. The formerly dominant view that Hobbes espoused psychological egoism as the foundation of his moral theory is currently widely rejected, and there has been to date no fully systematic study of Hobbes’s moral psychology.


17世纪的英国哲学家托马斯·霍布斯现在被广泛认为是少数真正伟大的政治哲学家之一，他的代表作《利维坦》在重要性上可与柏拉图、亚里士多德、洛克、卢梭、康德和罗尔斯的政治著作相媲美。霍布斯因其早期对“社会契约论”的精心阐发而闻名于世，“社会契约论”是一种通过诉诸处于适当条件下的理性、自由和平等的人之间达成的协议来证成政治原则或政治约定的方法。霍布斯之所以臭名昭著，是因为他利用社会契约论的方法得出了一个令人惊讶的结论，即：我们应该服从一个绝对的——意即统一的和不受限制的——主权权力的权威。虽然他在方法论上的创新对后来的政治哲学工作产生了深远的建设性影响，但他的实质性结论主要是作为一种衬托，用来发展更可接受的哲学立场。与霍布斯的政治哲学相比，霍布斯的道德哲学影响较小，部分是因为其理论过于模糊，无法就其内容达成任何普遍共识。大多数学者认为霍布斯肯定了某种程度的个人相对主义或主观主义；但关于霍布斯信奉神圣命令理论、德性伦理学、规则利己主义或某种形式的投射主义的观点也有霍布斯的文本和学者支持。因为霍布斯认为“关于自然法（Lawes of Nature）的真正学说就是真正的道德哲学”，对霍布斯道德哲学的不同解释可以追溯到对霍布斯“自然法”的地位和运作的不同理解，下文将讨论这些自然法。以前的主流观点认为霍布斯支持心理利己主义，作为其道德理论的基础，如今这种观点已被广泛否定，迄今为止还没有对霍布斯的道德心理学进行全面系统的研究。

## 1.主要政治著作

Hobbes wrote several versions of his political philosophy, including The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic (also under the titles Human Nature and De Corpore Politico) published in 1650, De Cive (1642) published in English as Philosophical Rudiments Concerning Government and Society in 1651, the English Leviathan published in 1651, and its Latin revision in 1668. Others of his works are also important in understanding his political philosophy, especially his history of the English Civil War, Behemoth (published 1679), De Corpore (1655), De Homine (1658), Dialogue Between a Philosopher and a Student of the Common Laws of England (1681), and The Questions Concerning Liberty, Necessity, and Chance (1656). All of Hobbes’s major writings are collected in The English Works of Thomas Hobbes, edited by Sir William Molesworth (11 volumes, London 1839–45), and Thomae Hobbes Opera Philosophica Quae Latina Scripsit Omnia, also edited by Molesworth (5 volumes; London, 1839–45). Oxford University Press has undertaken a projected 26 volume collection of the Clarendon Edition of the Works of Thomas Hobbes. So far 3 volumes are available: De Cive (edited by Howard Warrender), The Correspondence of Thomas Hobbes (edited by Noel Malcolm), and Writings on Common Law and Hereditary Right (edited by Alan Cromartie and Quentin Skinner). Recently Noel Malcolm has published a three volume edition of Leviathan, which places the English text side by side with Hobbes’s later Latin version of it. Readers new to Hobbes should begin with Leviathan, being sure to read Parts Three and Four, as well as the more familiar and often excerpted Parts One and Two. There are many fine overviews of Hobbes’s normative philosophy, some of which are listed in the following selected bibliography of secondary works.


霍布斯撰写了多个版本的政治哲学著作，包括1650年出版的《自然法和政治法要义（The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic）》（又名《人性和政治体（Human Nature and De Corpore Politico）》），1651年以《关于政府与社会的哲学基本原理（Philosophical Rudiments Concerning Government and Society）》为标题出版的英文版《论公民（De Cive，1642年）》，1651年出版的英文版《利维坦》以及1668年出版的拉丁文修订版。他的其他作品对于理解他的政治哲学也是重要的，尤其是他的英国内战史《比希莫特（Behemoth）》（1679年出版），《论身体（De Corpore）》（1655年），《论人类（De Homine）》（1658年）、《哲学家与英国普通法学生之间的对话（Dialogue Between a Philosopher and a Student of the Common Laws of England）》（1681年）以及《关于自由、必然性和偶然性的问题（The Questions Concerning Liberty, Necessity, and Chance）》（1656年）。霍布斯的所有主要作品都收录在威廉·莫尔斯沃斯爵士（Sir William Molesworth）编辑的《托马斯·霍布斯英语作品集》（11卷，1839-1845年，伦敦）和同样由莫尔斯沃斯编辑的《托马斯·霍布斯拉丁语哲学作品（Philosophica Quae Latina Scripsit Omnia）》（5卷，1839-1845年，伦敦）中。牛津大学出版社计划出版26卷《克拉伦登版托马斯·霍布斯作品集》。目前已出版3卷： 《论公民（De Cive）》（由Howard Warrender编辑）、《托马斯·霍布斯书信集》（由Noel Malcolm编辑）以及《关于普通法和世袭权利的著作》（由Alan Cromartie和Quentin Skinner编辑）。最近，Noel Malcolm出版了三卷本的《利维坦》，将英文文本与霍布斯后来的拉丁文文本并列排版在一起。初读霍布斯的读者应该从《利维坦》开始，务必要阅读第三部分和第四部分，以及更为熟悉且经常被引用的第一部分和第二部分。关于霍布斯的规范性哲学，有许多很好的概述，其中一些列在下面的二手作品参考书目中。

## 2.哲学计划

Hobbes sought to discover rational principles for the construction of a civil polity that would not be subject to destruction from within. Having lived through the period of political disintegration culminating in the English Civil War, he came to the view that the burdens of even the most oppressive government are “scarce sensible, in respect of the miseries, and horrible calamities, that accompany a Civill Warre”. Because virtually any government would be better than a civil war, and, according to Hobbes’s analysis, all but absolute governments are systematically prone to dissolution into civil war, people ought to submit themselves to an absolute political authority. Continued stability will require that they also refrain from the sorts of actions that might undermine such a regime. For example, subjects should not dispute the sovereign power and under no circumstances should they rebel. In general, Hobbes aimed to demonstrate the reciprocal relationship between political obedience and peace.


霍布斯试图为建立一个不会从内部遭到破坏的公民政治体探索合理的原则。经历了以英国内战为顶峰的政治分裂时期后，他认为，即使是最专制的政府带来的重担“与伴随内战而来的苦难和可怕灾难相比，也是微不足道的”。因为实际上任何政府都比内战要好，而且根据霍布斯的分析，除了绝对政府（absolute governments）之外的任何政府都系统性地倾向于在内战中解体，所以人们应该服从绝对的政治权威。为了保证持续的稳定，人们还必须避免可能会破坏这样一个政权的行动。比如，臣民不应对主权权力提出异议，在任何情况下都不得造反。总之，霍布斯旨在证明政治服从与和平之间的相互关系。

## 3.自然状态

To establish these conclusions, Hobbes invites us to consider what life would be like in a state of nature, that is, a condition without government. Perhaps we would imagine that people might fare best in such a state, where each decides for herself how to act, and is judge, jury and executioner in her own case whenever disputes arise—and that at any rate, this state is the appropriate baseline against which to judge the justifiability of political arrangements. Hobbes terms this situation “the condition of mere nature”, a state of perfectly private judgment, in which there is no agency with recognized authority to arbitrate disputes and effective power to enforce its decisions.


为了得出这些结论，霍布斯请我们思考自然状态下的生活会是什么样子（自然状态就是没有政府的状态）。也许我们会想象，在这样一种状态下，人们可能会过得最好。在这种状态下，每个人都自己决定如何行动，并且在出现纠纷时，每个人都是自己案件的法官、陪审团和执行者——无论如何，这种状态是判断政治安排正当性（justifiability）的适当基准。霍布斯将这种情况称为“纯粹自然的状态”，即完全凭私意判断的状态，在这种状态下，没有任何机构拥有仲裁纠纷的公认权威和执行其决定的有效权力。


Hobbes’s near descendant, John Locke, insisted in his Second Treatise of Government that the state of nature was indeed to be preferred to subjection to the arbitrary power of an absolute sovereign. But Hobbes famously argued that such a “dissolute condition of masterlesse men, without subjection to Lawes, and a coercive Power to tye their hands from rapine, and revenge” would make impossible all of the basic security upon which comfortable, sociable, civilized life depends. There would be “no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; and which is worst of all, continuall feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.” If this is the state of nature, people have strong reasons to avoid it, which can be done only by submitting to some mutually recognized public authority, for “so long a man is in the condition of mere nature, (which is a condition of war,) as private appetite is the measure of good and evill.”


霍布斯的学术后裔约翰·洛克在其《政府论》第二卷中坚持认为，自然状态确实比服从绝对主权者的专断权力更好。但霍布斯有一个著名论点主张，这种“没有法律约束、没有强制力约束无主之人的手，使他们不要劫掠和报复他人的放荡状态”，将使舒适、友好、文明的生活所依赖的所有基本安全成为不可能。在这种状况下“产业是无法存在的，因为其成果不稳定。这样一来，举凡土地的栽培、航海、外洋进口商品的运用、舒适的建筑、移动与卸除须费巨大力量的物体的工具、地貌的知识、时间的记载、文艺、文学、社会等等都将不存在。最糟糕的是人们不断处于暴力死亡的恐惧和危险中，人的生活孤独、贫困、卑污、残忍而短寿。”如果这就是自然状态，那么人们就有充分的理由避免这种状态，而要做到这一点，只有服从某种共同认可的公共权威，因为“只要人处于纯粹自然的状态（这是一种战争状态）中，个人的欲望就是衡量善恶的标准”。


Although many readers have criticized Hobbes’s state of nature as unduly pessimistic, he constructs it from a number of individually plausible empirical and normative assumptions. He assumes that people are sufficiently similar in their mental and physical attributes that no one is invulnerable nor can expect to be able to dominate the others. Hobbes assumes that people generally “shun death”, and that the desire to preserve their own lives is very strong in most people. While people have local affections, their benevolence is limited, and they have a tendency to partiality. Concerned that others should agree with their own high opinions of themselves, people are sensitive to slights. They make evaluative judgments, but often use seemingly impersonal terms like ‘good’ and ‘bad’ to stand for their own personal preferences. They are curious about the causes of events, and anxious about their futures; according to Hobbes, these characteristics incline people to adopt religious beliefs, although the content of those beliefs will differ depending upon the sort of religious education one has happened to receive.


尽管许多读者批评霍布斯的自然状态过于悲观，但他是根据一些个别看来似乎合理的经验性和规范性假设构建自然状态的。他假设，人们的智力和身体状况具有足够的相似性，因此没有人是无懈可击的，也没有人可以指望能够统治他人。霍布斯假定人们普遍地“逃避死亡”，大多数人都有非常强烈的保全自己生命的欲望。尽管人们有乡土情结，但他们的善意是有限的，而且他们有偏袒的倾向。人们希望别人也能认同他们对自己的好评，因此对他人的轻视十分敏感。他们会做出评价性的判断，但经常使用“好”和“坏”等看似不近人情的词语来代表自己的个人喜好。他们对事件的起因感到好奇，对自己的未来感到焦虑。霍布斯认为，这些特征使人们倾向于接受宗教信仰，尽管这些信仰的内容会因人们偶然接受的宗教教育而有所不同。


With respect to normative assumptions, Hobbes ascribes to each person in the state of nature a liberty right to preserve herself, which he terms “the right of nature”. This is the right to do whatever one sincerely judges needful for one’s preservation; yet because it is at least possible that virtually anything might be judged necessary for one’s preservation, this theoretically limited right of nature becomes in practice an unlimited right to potentially anything, or, as Hobbes puts it, a right “to all things”. Hobbes further assumes as a principle of practical rationality, that people should adopt what they see to be the necessary means to their most important ends.


关于规范性假设，霍布斯赋予自然状态下的每个人以保护自己的自由权利，他称之为“自然权利”。这是指一个人真诚地认为为了保护自己而有必要做任何事情的权利；然而，由于至少有可能断定几乎任何事情都是对于保护自己来说所必需的，这种理论上有限的自然权利在实践中就变成了对潜在的任何事情的无限权利，或者如霍布斯所说，是一种“对一切事物”的权利。霍布斯进一步假定，作为实践理性的一项原则，人们应该采取他们认为必要的手段来达到他们最重要的目的。


## 4.自然状态就是战争状态

Taken together, these plausible descriptive and normative assumptions yield a state of nature potentially fraught with divisive struggle. The right of each to all things invites serious conflict, especially if there is competition for resources, as there will surely be over at least scarce goods such as the most desirable lands, spouses, etc. People will quite naturally fear that others may (citing the right of nature) invade them, and may rationally plan to strike first as an anticipatory defense. Moreover, that minority of prideful or “vain-glorious” persons who take pleasure in exercising power over others will naturally elicit preemptive defensive responses from others. Conflict will be further fueled by disagreement in religious views, in moral judgments, and over matters as mundane as what goods one actually needs, and what respect one properly merits. Hobbes imagines a state of nature in which each person is free to decide for herself what she needs, what she’s owed, what’s respectful, right, pious, prudent, and also free to decide all of these questions for the behavior of everyone else as well, and to act on her judgments as she thinks best, enforcing her views where she can. In this situation where there is no common authority to resolve these many and serious disputes, we can easily imagine with Hobbes that the state of nature would become a “state of war”, even worse, a war of “all against all”.


综合来看，这些似乎合理的描述性和规范性假设产生了一种可能充满分裂斗争的自然状态。每个人对一切事物的权利会引发严重的冲突，尤其是存在对资源的竞争的情况下，因为至少在稀缺物品（如最肥美的土地、配偶等）方面肯定会存在竞争。人们会很自然地担心他人会（以自然权利为由）侵害自己，并可能理性地计划先下手为强来实现一种预期性的防御。此外，少数骄傲或“爱慕虚荣”的人以对他人行使权力为乐，自然会引起他人先发制人的防御反应。在宗教观点、道德判断以及一个人究竟需要什么物品、一个人应该得到什么尊重等普通问题上的分歧，都会进一步加剧冲突。霍布斯想象的自然状态是，每个人都可以自由地决定自己需要什么、应该得到什么、什么是值得尊重的、正确的、虔诚的、谨慎的，也可以自由地替其他所有人决定所有这些问题，并按照自己认为正确的判断行事，在力所能及的范围内实践自己的观点。在这种情况下，如果没有一个共同的权威来解决这些众多而严重的纠纷，我们很容易和霍布斯一样，想象自然状态会变成“战争状态”，甚至更糟，变成一场“一切人反对一切人”的战争。

## 5.关于自然状态的进一步问题

In response to the natural question whether humanity ever was generally in any such state of nature, Hobbes gives three examples of putative states of nature. First, he notes that all sovereigns are in this state with respect to one another. This claim has made Hobbes the representative example of a “realist” in international relations. Second, he opined that many now civilized peoples were formerly in that state, and some few peoples—“the savage people in many places of America” (Leviathan, XIII), for instance—were still to his day in the state of nature. Third and most significantly, Hobbes asserts that the state of nature will be easily recognized by those whose formerly peaceful states have collapsed into civil war. While the state of nature’s condition of perfectly private judgment is an abstraction, something resembling it too closely for comfort remains a perpetually present possibility, to be feared, and avoided.


在回答“人类是否曾经普遍处于这种自然状态”这一自然的问题时，霍布斯列举了三个被认为是自然状态的例子。首先，他指出，所有主权者彼此之间都处于这种状态。这一主张使霍布斯成为国际关系中“现实主义者”的代表。其次，他认为，许多现在的文明人以前都处于这种状态，而一些少数群体——例如“美洲许多地方的野蛮人”（《利维坦》，XIII）——直到他的时代仍处于自然状态。第三，也是最重要的一点，霍布斯断言，自然状态很容易被那些生活在原本和平但后来因内战而崩溃的国家的人所认识。虽然自然状态中完全凭私意判断的条件是一种抽象概念，但与之非常类似的情况仍然是一种永远存在的可能性，值得恐惧和避免。


Do the other assumptions of Hobbes’s philosophy license the existence of this imagined state of isolated individuals pursuing their private judgments? Probably not, since, as feminist critics among others have noted, children are by Hobbes’s theory assumed to have undertaken an obligation of obedience to their parents in exchange for nurturing, and so the primitive units in the state of nature will include families ordered by internal obligations, as well as individuals. The bonds of affection, sexual affinity, and friendship—as well as of clan membership and shared religious belief—may further decrease the accuracy of any purely individualistic model of the state of nature. This concession need not impugn Hobbes’s analysis of conflict in the state of nature, since it may turn out that competition, diffidence and glory-seeking are disastrous sources of conflicts among small groups just as much as they are among individuals. Still, commentators seeking to answer the question how precisely we should understand Hobbes’s state of nature are investigating the degree to which Hobbes imagines that to be a condition of interaction among isolated individuals.


霍布斯哲学的其他假设是否允许这种由孤立个体追求其私意判断的想象状态的存在？可能不会，因为正如一些女权主义批评家所指出的，霍布斯的理论假定儿童承担了顺服父母的义务，以换取养育，因此自然状态中的原始单位将包括以内部义务为秩序的家庭以及个人。感情、性关系和友谊的纽带——包括氏族成员身份和共同的宗教信仰——可能会进一步降低任何纯粹由个体构成的自然状态模型的准确性。这一让步并不一定会影响霍布斯对自然状态下冲突的分析，因为事实可能证明，竞争、不自信和追求荣耀也是小团体之间冲突的灾难性根源，与个人之间冲突的情形一样。尽管如此，那些试图回答我们应该如何准确理解霍布斯自然状态这一问题的评论家们，正在研究霍布斯在多大程度上将自然状态想象为孤立个体之间的互动状态。


Another important open question is that of what, exactly, it is about human beings that makes it the case (supposing Hobbes is right) that our communal life is prone to disaster when we are left to interact according only to our own individual judgments. Perhaps, while people do wish to act for their own best long-term interest, they are shortsighted, and so indulge their current interests without properly considering the effects of their current behavior on their long-term interest. This would be a type of failure of rationality. Alternatively, it may be that people in the state of nature are fully rational, but are trapped in a situation that makes it individually rational for each to act in a way that is sub-optimal for all, perhaps finding themselves in the familiar ‘prisoner’s dilemma’ of game theory. Or again, it may be that Hobbes’s state of nature would be peaceful but for the presence of persons (just a few, or perhaps all, to some degree) whose passions overrule their calmer judgments; who are prideful, spiteful, partial, envious, jealous, and in other ways prone to behave in ways that lead to war. Such an account would understand irrational human passions to be the source of conflict. Which, if any, of these accounts adequately answers to Hobbes’s text is a matter of continuing debate among Hobbes scholars. Game theorists have been particularly active in these debates, experimenting with different models for the state of nature and the conflict it engenders.


另一个重要的悬而未决的问题是，人类究竟是什么原因（假设霍布斯是对的），使我们的公共生活在只根据自己的个人判断进行互动时容易陷入灾难。也许，尽管人们确实希望为自己的最佳长期利益而行动，但他们目光短浅，因此沉溺于自己当前的利益，而没有适当考虑当前行为对其长期利益的影响。这就是一种理性的缺失。另一种情况是，自然状态下的人们是完全理性的，但却陷入了这样一种境地，即每个人的理性行为对所有人来说都是次优的，这或许就是我们所熟悉的博弈论中的“囚徒困境”。又或者，霍布斯的自然状态本来是和平的，但由于一些人（只是少数人，或者在某种程度上可能是所有人）的激情压倒了他们冷静的判断；这些人骄傲、心怀恶意、偏袒、嫉妒、妒忌，并在其他方面容易做出导致战争的行为。这种观点将非理性的人类激情理解为冲突的根源。在这些观点中，哪一种观点能够充分地解释霍布斯的文本，是霍布斯的研究者们一直争论不休的问题。主张博弈论观点的研究者在这些争论中尤为活跃，他们为解释自然状态及其引发的冲突尝试了不同的模型。

## 6.自然法

Hobbes argues that the state of nature is a miserable state of war in which none of our important human ends are reliably realizable. Happily, human nature also provides resources to escape this miserable condition. Hobbes argues that each of us, as a rational being, can see that a war of all against all is inimical to the satisfaction of her interests, and so can agree that “peace is good, and therefore also the way or means of peace are good”. Humans will recognize as imperatives the injunction to seek peace, and to do those things necessary to secure it, when they can do so safely. Hobbes calls these practical imperatives “Lawes of Nature”, the sum of which is not to treat others in ways we would not have them treat us. These “precepts”, “conclusions” or “theorems” of reason are “eternal and immutable”, always commanding our assent even when they may not safely be acted upon. They forbid many familiar vices such as iniquity, cruelty, and ingratitude. Although commentators do not agree on whether these laws should be regarded as mere precepts of prudence, or rather as divine commands, or moral imperatives of some other sort, all agree that Hobbes understands them to direct people to submit to political authority. They tell us to seek peace with willing others by laying down part of our “right to all things”, by mutually covenanting to submit to the authority of a sovereign, and further direct us to keep that covenant establishing sovereignty.


霍布斯认为，自然状态是一种悲惨的战争状态，在这种状态下，人类的任何重要目标都无法可靠地实现。幸运的是，人性也提供了摆脱这种悲惨状态的资源。霍布斯认为，作为一个理性的存在，我们每个人都能看到，一切人反对一切人的战争不利于满足自己的利益，因此可以同意“和平是好的，因此实现和平的方式或手段也是好的”。人类将认识到，在能够安全地实现和平的情况下，寻求和平并采取必要行动以确保和平是当务之急。霍布斯称这些实践命令为“自然法则”，其总和就是不要以我们不希望别人对待我们的方式对待别人。这些理性的“戒律”、“结论”或“定理”是“永恒不变的”，即使在无法安全地付诸行动的情况下，也总能得到我们的认同。它们禁止许多耳熟能详的恶行，如不义、残忍和忘恩负义。虽然评论家们对于是否应该将这些法则仅仅视为谨慎的戒律、神的命令或其他类型的道德命令并没有达成共识，但他们都同意霍布斯认为这些法则的目的是引导人们服从政治权威。这些自然法则告诉我们，要想与其他自愿和平的人相处，就必须放下部分“对一切事物的权利”，共同立约服从主权者的权威，这些法则进一步指示我们遵守那个确立主权的契约。

## 7.建立主权机构

When people mutually covenant each to the others to obey a common authority, they have established what Hobbes calls “sovereignty by institution”. When, threatened by a conqueror, they covenant for protection by promising obedience, they have established “sovereignty by acquisition”. These are equally legitimate ways of establishing sovereignty, according to Hobbes, and their underlying motivation is the same—namely fear—whether of one’s fellows or of a conqueror. The social covenant involves both the renunciation or transfer of right and the authorization of the sovereign power. Political legitimacy depends not on how a government came to power, but only on whether it can effectively protect those who have consented to obey it; political obligation ends when protection ceases.


当人们彼此立约服从共同的权威时，他们就建立了霍布斯所说的“通过制度建立的主权”。当人们受到外部征服者的威胁时，他们立约承诺顺从这个征服者的权威来获得保护，这就是“通过获取建立的主权”。霍布斯认为，这些都是同等合法的确立主权的方式，其根本动机都是一样的，那就是恐惧——无论是对同胞的恐惧还是对征服者的恐惧。社会契约既涉及权利的放弃或转让，也涉及对主权权力的授权。政治合法性并不取决于政府是如何掌权的，而只取决于它能否有效地保护那些同意服从它的人；当保护停止时，政治义务也就终止了。

## 8.绝对主义

Although Hobbes offered some mild pragmatic grounds for preferring monarchy to other forms of government, his main concern was to argue that effective government—whatever its form—must have absolute authority. Its powers must be neither divided nor limited. The powers of legislation, adjudication, enforcement, taxation, war-making (and the less familiar right of control of normative doctrine) are connected in such a way that a loss of one may thwart effective exercise of the rest; for example, legislation without interpretation and enforcement will not serve to regulate conduct. Only a government that possesses all of what Hobbes terms the “essential rights of sovereignty” can be reliably effective, since where partial sets of these rights are held by different bodies that disagree in their judgments as to what is to be done, paralysis of effective government, or degeneration into a civil war to settle their dispute, may occur.


尽管霍布斯为君主制优于其他形式的政府提供了一些温和务实的理由，但他主要关注的是论证有效的政府——无论其形式如何——必须具有绝对权威。它的权力必须既不被分割也不受限制。立法权、裁决权、执法权、征税权、战争权（以及人们不太熟悉的对规范性原则的控制权）是相互关联的，失去其中一项权力就可能阻碍其他权力的有效行使；例如，没有解释权和执法权的立法权将无法起到规范行为的作用。只有一个拥有全部霍布斯所说的“主权的核心权利”的政府才能可靠有效，因为如果这些权利中的部分权利由不同的机构掌握，而这些机构对于应该做什么的判断存在分歧，就有可能导致有效政府的瘫痪，或演变为一场解决争端的内战。


Similarly, to impose limitation on the authority of the government is to invite irresoluble disputes over whether it has overstepped those limits. If each person is to decide for herself whether the government should be obeyed, factional disagreement—and war to settle the issue, or at least paralysis of effective government—are quite possible. To refer resolution of the question to some further authority, itself also limited and so open to challenge for overstepping its bounds, would be to initiate an infinite regress of non-authoritative ‘authorities’ (where the buck never stops). To refer it to a further authority itself unlimited, would be just to relocate the seat of absolute sovereignty, a position entirely consistent with Hobbes’s insistence on absolutism. To avoid the horrible prospect of governmental collapse and return to the state of nature, people should treat their sovereign as having absolute authority.


同样，如果对政府的权威施加限制，就会在政府是否越权的问题上产生无法解决的争端。如果每个人都能自己决定是否应该服从政府，那么就很有可能出现党派分歧，要解决这个问题就可能引发战争，或者至少使有效的政府陷于瘫痪。如果将问题的解决提交给另一个权威机构，而这个权威机构本身也是受限的，因此有可能因越权而受到质疑，这就会导致非权威“权威”的无限倒退（在这种情况下，倒退永远不会停止）。如果将其提交给另一个本身也是不受限制的权威，那就只是将绝对主权的所在地移到了别处，而这与霍布斯坚持绝对主义的立场是完全一致的。为了避免政府崩溃和回归自然状态的可怕前景，人们应该把他们的主权者视为拥有绝对权威的人。

## 9.责任与政治义务的限度

When subjects institute a sovereign by authorizing it, they agree, in conformity with the principle “no wrong is done to a consenting party”, not to hold it liable for any errors in judgment it may make and not to treat any harms it does to them as actionable injustices. Although many interpreters have assumed that by authorizing a sovereign, subjects become morally responsible for the actions it commands, Hobbes instead insists that “the external actions done in obedience to \[laws\], without the inward approbation, are the actions of the sovereign, and not of the subject, which is in that case but as an instrument, without any motion of his own at all” (Leviathan xlii, 106). It may be important to Hobbes’s project of persuading his Christian readers to obey their sovereign that he can reassure them that God will not hold them responsible for wrongful actions done at the sovereign’s command, because they cannot reasonably be expected to obey if doing so would jeopardize their eternal prospects. Hence Hobbes explains that “whatsoever a subject...is compelled to do in obedience to his sovereign, and doth it not in order to his own mind, but in order to the laws of his country, that action is not his, but his sovereign’s.” (Leviathan xlii. 11) This position reinforces absolutism by permitting Hobbes to maintain that subjects can obey even commands to perform actions they believe to be sinful without fear of divine punishment.


当臣民通过授权建立一个主权国家时，他们同意，根据“经同意的行为无过错”的原则，不要求主权国家为其可能做出的任何判断错误负责，也不将主权国家对他们造成的任何伤害视为有待追究法律责任的不公正。尽管许多解释者都认为，臣民因着授权主权者便需要对主权者命令的行为承担道德责任，但霍布斯却坚持认为，“如果臣民对\[法律\]的服从仅表现为外在行动而缺乏内心认可，则此类行为当归属于主权者而非臣民——在此情形下，臣民不过是全然被动之工具”（《利维坦》xlii，106）。霍布斯为了说服他的基督徒读者顺服他们的主权者，很重要的一个方面在于：他必须向这些读者保证，上帝不会因他们在主权者命令之下的错误行为而追究他们的责任。因为如果顺服主权者的行为可能危及他们永恒的救赎，就不能合理地期待人们继续顺服。因此霍布斯解释道：“臣民……为顺服主权者而被迫做出的任何行为，只要该行为不是出于自身意志，而是出于国家法律的要求，那么该行为的责任主体就不是他本人，而是主权者。”（《利维坦》xlii. 11）这一立场藉着允许霍布斯主张“臣民即便服从那些要求他们执行他们自己认为有罪的行为的命令，也无需惧怕神的惩罚”，从而强化了绝对主义理论。


Hobbes’s description of the way in which persons should be understood to become subjects to a sovereign authority changes from his Elements and De Cive accounts to his Leviathan account. In the former, each person lays down their rights (of self-government and to pursue all things they judge useful or necessary for their survival and commodious living) in favor of one and the same sovereign person (whether a natural person, as a monarch, or an artificial person, as a rule-governed assembly). In these earlier accounts, sovereigns alone retain their right of nature to act on their own private judgment in all matters, and also exercise the transferred rights of subjects. Whether exercising its own retained right of nature or the subjects’ transferred rights, the sovereign’s action is attributable to the sovereign itself, and it bears moral responsibility for it. In contrast, Hobbes’s Leviathan account has each individual covenanting to “own and authorize” all of the sovereign’s actions—whatever the sovereign does as a public figure or commands that subjects do. This change creates an apparent inconsistency in Hobbes’s theory of responsibility for actions done at the sovereign’s command; if in “owning and authorizing” all their sovereign’s actions, subjects become morally responsible for all that it does and all they do in obedience to its commands, Hobbes cannot consistently maintain his position that merely obedient actions in response to sovereign commands are the moral responsibility of the sovereign alone. One resolution of this apparent inconsistency denies that Hobbes’s idea of authorization carries along responsibility for the act authorized, as our contemporary idea of authorization generally does.


霍布斯对于人如何成为主权权威臣民的描述，从其著作《自然法和政治法要义》和《论公民》的论述，到《利维坦》中的论述发生了变化。在前面的著作中，每个人都放弃了自己的权利（自治权和追求他们认为对自己的生存和舒适生活有用或必要的一切事物的权利），转而支持同一个主权者（无论是作为君主的自然人，还是作为基于规则统治的议会的人造人）。在这些早期论述中，只有主权者保留了自己的自然权利，以便在所有事务中根据自己的个人判断行事，同时也行使臣民让渡给他的权利。无论是行使主权者自己保留的自然权利，还是行使臣民让渡给他的权利，主权者的行为都归于主权者自身，主权者自己对此负有道德责任。与此相反，霍布斯的《利维坦》论证说，每个人都立约“拥有并授权”主权者的所有行为——无论是主权者以公众人物的身份做的，还是命令臣民做的。这一变化在霍布斯关于臣民在主权者命令之下所行之事的责任的理论中造成了明显的不一致；如果在“拥有并授权”他们主权者的所有行为时，臣民对主权者所做的一切以及他们顺服主权者命令所做的一切都负有道德责任，那么霍布斯就不能始终坚持他的立场，即单纯顺服主权者命令的行为只包含主权者自己的道德责任。解决这一明显矛盾的一个办法是，否认霍布斯关于授权的思想带有对授权之行为的责任，就如同我们当代关于授权的思想一般会做的。


While Hobbes insists that we should regard our governments as having absolute authority, he reserves to subjects the liberty of disobeying some of their government’s commands. He argues that subjects retain a right of self-defense against the sovereign power, giving them the right to disobey or resist when their lives are in danger. He also gives them seemingly broad resistance rights in cases in which their families or even their honor are at stake. These exceptions have understandably intrigued those who study Hobbes. His ascription of apparently inalienable rights—what he calls the “true liberties of subjects”—seems incompatible with his defense of absolute sovereignty. Moreover, if the sovereign’s failure to provide adequate protection to subjects extinguishes their obligation to obey, and if it is left to each subject to judge for herself the adequacy of that protection, it seems that people have never really exited the fearsome state of nature. This aspect of Hobbes’s political philosophy has been hotly debated ever since Hobbes’s time. Bishop Bramhall, one of Hobbes’s contemporaries, famously accused Leviathan of being a “Rebell’s Catechism.” More recently, some commentators have argued that Hobbes’s discussion of the limits of political obligation is the Achilles’ heel of his theory. It is not clear whether or not this charge can stand up to scrutiny, but it will surely be the subject of much continued discussion.


虽然霍布斯坚持认为我们的政府应该拥有绝对的权威，但他也为臣民保留了不服从政府某些命令的自由。他认为，臣民保留了对主权权力的自卫权，当他们的生命受到威胁时，他们有权不服从或反抗。他还赋予臣民在家人甚至荣誉受到威胁时似乎广泛的抵抗权。这些例外情况引起了霍布斯研究者的兴趣，这是可以理解的。他所赋予的看似不可剥夺的权利——他称之为“臣民的真正自由”——似乎与他为绝对主权所做的辩护格格不入。此外，如果主权者未能为臣民提供足够的保护，臣民就不再有顺服的义务，如果每个臣民有权自行判断这种保护是否足够，那么人们似乎从未真正摆脱可怕的自然状态。自霍布斯的时代以来，关于霍布斯政治哲学的这一方面一直存在着激烈的争论。与霍布斯同时代的布拉姆霍尔主教（Bishop Bramhall）曾批评《利维坦》是一本“叛逆者的教义”，这是他的一个著名的批评。最近，一些评论家认为，霍布斯对政治义务的限制是其理论的致命弱点。目前尚不清楚这一指控是否经得起推敲，但它必将成为人们持续争论的主题。

## 10.宗教与社会动荡

The last crucial aspect of Hobbes’s political philosophy is his treatment of religion. Hobbes progressively expands his discussion of Christian religion in each revision of his political philosophy, until it comes in Leviathan to comprise roughly half the book. There is no settled consensus on how Hobbes understands the significance of religion within his political theory. Some commentators have argued that Hobbes is trying to demonstrate to his readers the compatibility of his political theory with core Christian commitments, since it may seem that Christians’ religious duties forbid their affording the sort of absolute obedience to their governors which Hobbes’s theory requires of them. Others have doubted the sincerity of his professed Christianity, arguing that by the use of irony or other subtle rhetorical devices, Hobbes sought to undermine his readers’ religious beliefs. Howsoever his intentions are properly understood, Hobbes’s obvious concern with the power of religious belief is a fact that interpreters of his political philosophy must seek to explain.


霍布斯政治哲学的最后一个至关重要的方面是他对宗教的讨论。霍布斯在每次修订其政治哲学时，都会逐步扩大对基督教的讨论，直至在《利维坦》一书中对基督教的讨论约占全书的一半篇幅。对于霍布斯如何理解宗教在其政治理论中的意义，目前尚无定论。部分评论家认为，霍布斯试图向读者证明他的政治理论与核心的基督教教义是相容的，因为表面上基督徒的宗教义务似乎禁止他们像霍布斯理论所要求的那样对统治者绝对顺服。另一些学者质疑他自称自己是基督徒的立场是否真诚，并认为霍布斯通过使用反讽或其他精妙的修辞手段，试图破坏读者的宗教信仰。无论如何正确理解霍布斯的意图，他对宗教信仰力量的明显关注都是其政治哲学的阐释者必须努力解释的事实。

## 11.霍布斯论性别与种族

Scholars are increasingly interested in how Hobbes thought of the status of women, and of the family. Hobbes was one of the earliest western philosophers to count women as persons when devising a social contract among persons. He insists on the equality of all people, very explicitly including women. People are equal because they are all subject to domination, and all potentially capable of dominating others. No person is so strong as to be invulnerable to attack while sleeping by the concerted efforts of others, nor is any so strong as to be assured of dominating all others.


学者们对于霍布斯如何看待妇女和家庭的地位越来越感兴趣。霍布斯是最早的在制订人与人之间的社会契约时将妇女视为人的西方哲学家之一。他坚持人人平等，非常明确地将妇女包括在内。人与人之所以平等，是因为他们都受他人支配，并都有支配他人的潜在能力。没有人能够强大到在熟睡时也能免遭众人合力的袭击，也没有人能够强大到足以确保统治所有其他的人。


In this relevant sense, women are naturally equal to men. They are equally naturally free, meaning that their consent is required before they will be under the authority of anyone else. In this, Hobbes’s claims stand in stark contrast to many prevailing views of the time, according to which women were born inferior to and subordinate to men. Sir Robert Filmer, who later served as the target of John Locke’s First Treatise of Government, is a well-known proponent of this view, which he calls patriarchalism. Explicitly rejecting the patriarchalist view as well as Salic law, Hobbes maintains that women can be sovereigns; authority for him is “neither male nor female”. He also argues for natural maternal right: in the state of nature, dominion over children naturally belongs to the mother. He adduced the example of the Amazon warrior women as evidence.


从这个意义上讲，女性天生与男性平等。她们同样享有天生的自由，也就是说，他人在统治她们之前，必须先征得她们自己的同意。在这一点上，霍布斯的主张与当时普遍盛行的观点形成了鲜明对比，根据这些观点，女性天生就比男性低等并从属于男性。罗伯特·菲尔默爵士（Sir Robert Filmer）——此人后来成为约翰·洛克《政府论》首篇的批判对象——正是这一观点的著名倡导者，他将其理论称为父权主义（patriarchalism）。霍布斯在明确拒斥父权主义（patriarchalism）理论及萨利克继承法（Salic law，排斥女性继承权的法兰克法典）的同时，主张女性同样能够成为主权者；对他而言，权威的本质“无关性别”。他还主张自然的母权：在自然状态下，对子女的支配权自然属于母亲。他列举了亚马逊女战士（Amazon warrior women）的例子作为证据。


In seeming contrast to this egalitarian foundation, Hobbes spoke of the commonwealth in patriarchal language. In the move from the state of nature to civil society, families are described as “fathers”, “servants”, and “children”, seemingly obliterating mothers from the picture entirely. Hobbes justifies this way of talking by saying that it is fathers not mothers who have founded societies. As true as that is, it is easy to see how there is a lively debate between those who emphasize the potentially feminist or egalitarian aspects of Hobbes’s thought and those who emphasize his ultimate exclusion of women. Such debates raise the question: To what extent are the patriarchal claims Hobbes makes integral to his overall theory, if indeed they are integral at all?


尽管霍布斯的理论奠基于平等主义之上，但他在论述国家时却矛盾地采用了父权式话语。从自然状态到公民社会，家庭被描述为“父亲”、“仆人”和“孩子”，似乎将母亲完全排除在外。霍布斯为这种说法辩护说，是父亲而不是母亲建立了社会。尽管这是事实，但不难看出，在强调霍布斯思想中潜在的女权主义或平等主义方面的人与强调他最终排斥女性的人之间，存在着激烈的争论。这种辩论提出了一个问题： 霍布斯的父权主张在多大程度上是其整体理论的组成部分？


We find similar ambiguities and tensions in what Hobbes says about race (or what we would now call race). On the one hand, he invokes the “savages” of the Americas to illustrate the “brutish” conditions of life in the state of nature. On the other hand, when he simply denies that there are innate or immutable differences between Native Americans and Europeans. Societies which have enjoyed scientific advancement have done so, according to Hobbes, because of the existence of “leisure time,” and if that is “supposed away,” he asks rhetorically, “what do we differ from the wildest of the Indians?”


我们在霍布斯关于种族（或我们现在所说的种族）的论述中也发现了类似的模糊性和紧张性。一方面，他引用美洲的 “野蛮人 ”来说明自然状态下 “野蛮 ”的生活条件。另一方面，他干脆否认美洲原住民与欧洲人之间存在先天的或不可改变的差异。霍布斯认为，享有科学进步的社会之所以如此，是因为存在 “闲暇时间”，如果 “闲暇时间 ”被 “假定消失”，他反问道："我们与最野蛮的印第安人有何不同？
