Aristotle (b. 384–d. 322 BCE), was a Greek philosopher, logician, and scientist. Along with his teacher Plato, Aristotle is generally regarded as one of the most influential ancient thinkers in a number of philosophical fields, including political theory. Aristotle was born in Stagira in northern Greece, and his father was a court physician to the king of Macedon. As a young man he studied in Plato’s Academy in Athens. After Plato’s death he left Athens to conduct philosophical and biological research in Asia Minor and Lesbos, and he was then invited by King Philip II of Macedon to tutor his young son, Alexander the Great. Soon after Alexander succeeded his father, consolidated the conquest of the Greek city-states, and launched the invasion of the Persian Empire. Aristotle returned as a resident alien to Athens, and was a close friend of Antipater, the Macedonian viceroy. At this time (335–323 BCE) he wrote, or at least worked on, some of his major treatises, including the Politics. When Alexander died suddenly, Aristotle had to flee from Athens because of his Macedonian connections, and he died soon after. Aristotle’s life seems to have influenced his political thought in various ways: his interest in biology seems to be reflected in the naturalism of his politics; his interest in comparative politics and his qualified sympathies for democracy as well as monarchy may have been encouraged by his travels and experience of diverse political systems; he reacts critically to his teacher Plato, while borrowing extensively, from Plato’s Republic, Statesman, and Laws; and his own Politics is intended to guide rulers and statesmen, reflecting the high political circles in which he moved.


亚里士多德（生于公元前384年，卒于公元前322年）是希腊哲学家、逻辑学家和科学家。亚里士多德与他的老师柏拉图一同被公认为在包括政治理论在内的多个哲学领域最具影响力的古代思想家之一。亚里士多德出生于希腊北部的斯塔基拉，他的父亲是马其顿国王的御医。他年轻时曾在雅典的柏拉图学园学习。柏拉图死后，他离开雅典，到小亚细亚和莱斯沃斯岛进行哲学和生物学研究，后应马其顿国王菲利普二世之邀，辅导其幼子亚历山大大帝。不久，亚历山大继承父位，巩固了对希腊城邦的征服，并发动了对波斯帝国的入侵。（2025.2.5）亚里士多德作为外籍居民回到雅典，成为马其顿总督安提帕特的密友。在此期间（公元前 335 年至公元前 323 年），亚里士多德撰写了他的一些重要论著，其中包括《政治学》。亚历山大突然去世后，亚里士多德因与马其顿的关系不得不逃离雅典，不久便去世了。亚里士多德的生活似乎从不同方面影响了他的政治思想：他对生物学的兴趣似乎反映在他的政治学的自然主义中；他对比较政治学的兴趣以及他对民主和君主制的同情可能是受到他的旅行和对不同政治制度的体验的鼓励；他对他的老师柏拉图做出了批判性的反应，同时广泛借鉴了柏拉图的《共和国》、《政治家》和《法律》；他自己的《政治学》旨在指导统治者和政治家，反映了他所处的高级政治圈子。

## 一般政治学

The modern word ‘political’ derives from the Greek politikos, ‘of, or pertaining to, the polis’. (The Greek term polis will be translated here as ‘city-state’. It is also commonly translated as ‘city’ or simply anglicized as ‘polis’. City-states like Athens and Sparta were relatively small and cohesive units, in which political, religious, and cultural concerns were intertwined. The extent of their similarity to modern nation-states is controversial.) Aristotle’s word for ‘politics’ is politikê, which is short for politikê epistêmê or ‘political science’. It belongs to one of the three main branches of science, which Aristotle distinguishes by their ends or objects. Contemplative science (including physics and metaphysics) is concerned with truth or knowledge for its own sake; practical science with good action; and productive science with making useful or beautiful objects (Top. VI.6.145a14–16, Met. VI.1.1025b24, XI.7.1064a16–19, EN VI.2.1139a26–8). Politics is a practical science, since it is concerned with the noble action or happiness of the citizens (although it resembles a productive science in that it seeks to create, preserve, and reform political systems). Aristotle thus understands politics as a normative or prescriptive discipline rather than as a purely empirical or descriptive inquiry.


现代的 “政治 ”一词来源于希腊语 politikos，意为 “政治体制的，或与政治体制有关的”。（希腊语中的 polis 在这里将被翻译为 “城邦”。它通常也被译为 “城市”，或简单英译为 “polis”。雅典和斯巴达等城邦是相对较小且具有凝聚力的单位，其中政治、宗教和文化问题相互交织。它们与现代民族国家的相似程度还存在争议）。亚里士多德的 “政治 ”一词是 politikê，是 politikê epistêmê 或 “政治学 ”的简称。它属于科学的三大分支之一，亚里士多德根据其目的或对象对它们进行了区分。沉思科学（包括物理学和形而上学）关注的是真理或知识本身；实践科学关注的是良好的行动；生产科学关注的是制造有用或美丽的物品（Top. VI.6.145a14-16, Met. VI.1.1025b24, XI.7.1064a16-19, EN VI.2.1139a26-8）。政治学是一门实践科学，因为它关注的是公民的高尚行为或幸福（尽管它类似于一门生产科学，因为它寻求创造、维护和改革政治制度）。因此，亚里士多德将政治学理解为一门规范性或规定性学科，而非纯粹的经验性或描述性研究。


In the Nicomachean Ethics Aristotle describes his subject matter as ‘political science’, which he characterizes as the most authoritative science. It prescribes which sciences are to be studied in the city-state, and the others — such as military science, household management, and rhetoric — fall under its authority. Since it governs the other practical sciences, their ends serve as means to its end, which is nothing less than the human good. “Even if the end is the same for an individual and for a city-state, that of the city-state seems at any rate greater and more complete to attain and preserve. For although it is worthy to attain it for only an individual, it is nobler and more divine to do so for a nation or city-state” (EN I.2.1094b7–10). The two ethical works (the Nicomachean Ethics and the Eudemian Ethics) explain the principles that form the foundations for the Politics: that happiness is the highest human good, that happiness is the activity of moral virtue defined in terms of the mean, and that justice or the common advantage is the political good. Aristotle’s political science thus encompasses the two fields which modern philosophers distinguish as ethics and political philosophy. (See the entry on Aristotle’s ethics.) Political philosophy in the narrow sense is roughly speaking the subject of his treatise called the Politics. For a further discussion of this topic, see the following supplementary document:

在《尼各马可伦理学》中，亚里士多德将自己的研究课题称为 “政治学”，并将其描述为最权威的科学。政治学规定了城邦应学习哪些科学，而其他科学，如军事学、家政学和修辞学，都属于政治学的管辖范围。既然它管理着其他实用科学，那么这些科学的目的就是实现它的目的的手段，而它的目的就是人类的福祉。“即使个人和城邦的目的是相同的，城邦的目的无论如何似乎都更伟大、更完整，更值得实现和维护。因为尽管只为一个人实现它是值得的，但为一个民族或城邦实现它却是更崇高、更神圣的"（EN I.2.1094b7-10）。两部伦理学著作（《尼各马可伦理学》和《尤德米亚伦理学》）解释了构成《政治学》基础的原则：幸福是人类最高的善，幸福是以中庸定义的道德美德活动，正义或共同利益是政治善。因此，亚里士多德的政治学包含了现代哲学家区分为伦理学和政治哲学的两个领域。（见亚里士多德伦理学条目）狭义的政治哲学大致是他的论文《政治学》的主题。有关该主题的进一步讨论，请参阅以下补充文件：
